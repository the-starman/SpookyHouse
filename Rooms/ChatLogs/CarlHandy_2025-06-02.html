<p class="gmtext">Pushing her way into the foliage, Carmen stumbles a little bit on the vines. Some of the ones down below have a sort of sticky set of hairs to them, almost like velcro, which catch on her pants legs and shoestrings.

Bones, free floating. The front half of a horse, or at least its half dissolved remains. And perhaps the most concerning, the body of a man in a bathrobe, staring eyelessly out at the group.

<p class="gmtext">The group re-enters the house on the first floor. It's silent, dank, and musky, and it feels a bit more unsettling now compared to the earlier visit. They waste no time in making it up the stairs, and down the hall to the secret passageway. Opening it up, Carmen clambers through while Lillian holds the passageway over. A moment later, she exits with the axe in hand
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group Scooby Doos their way back down the stairs, slipping out as quickly as they entered.
