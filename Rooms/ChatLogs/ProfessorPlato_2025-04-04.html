</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: Helloooo
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: Welcome to Fantasy Grounds
</p>
<p class="info">UI Scale changed to 200%
</p>
<p class="info">UI Scale changed to 120%
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: If you want to change the size of the UI, then do /scaleui 120 (or another number)
</p>
<p class="info">UI Scale changed to 130%
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Ayji: okiee
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: Hawu's playing a constructon guy, Illy's playing a private detective, and Star's playing a professor. Did you have a preference on your Occupation? 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Ayji: not really I need to look over them again 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: If you check on the right under Library-&#62;Modules, you'll have access to the CoC 7e Reference
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: You can use that to view a list of them
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: Did you want to fully make a character, or do you want a pregen? 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Ayji: probably fully make a character so I can learn the rules a bit better
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: Sure!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: So to roll things in Fantasy Grounds, it uses a physics engine. Pick up a die by click and dragging, and toss it into the chat window to roll
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: Your character sheet will also have buttons on it that you can click to roll as well
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: I suppose we want your Occupation first, so let me know when you've got a general idea in mind? :3
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Also let me know if you want me on voice to walk you through any of this
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Ayji: whatever you're comfortable with! ^^
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Nuh-uh, whatever YOU'RE comfortable with &#62;:C
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Ayji: I'm thinking uh 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Ayji: Probably Entertainer
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Oh ;3
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Ayji: or Drifter
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: So I've Shared the two occupations with you here
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: The biggest difference between the two is the Occupation Skills you get, and the fact that Drifters have 0-5 Credit Rating, making them basically homeless
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Ayji: So I see two blank spaces on Entertainer listing interpersonal skills. I'm assuming those are essentially cross occupation skills that I can choose? 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: On Entertainer, you can pick any two Interpersonal Skills (Charm, Persuade, Intimidate, or Fast Talk). Charm lets you convince someone by being nice and pleasant, Persuade through logic, Intimidation through threats, and Fast Talk through bamboozlement
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: Fast Talk often lets you get away with the  most, but they realize they've been bamboozled at some point in the future
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: Drifter gets one, Entertainer gets two
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: The remaining two blank spots are for any skills you want, except for Credit Rating and Cthulhu Mythos
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Ayji: okie I think I&#34;ll go entertainer then 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: Okay! :D
</p>
<p class="emote">GM: Click on the Player-&#62;Characters button on the right hand side. You should see a character there with your name on it, do you see it?
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Click on the Player-&#62;Characters button on the right hand side. You should see a character there with your name on it, do you see it?
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: found it
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: :D
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: We'll use this as your character
</p>
<p class="gmtext">To roll your stats, left click a d6 to pick it up. Then, right click twice to duplicate it twice. Take those 3d6 and throw them into the chat window
</p>
<p class="info">Aya c::  [3d6 = 14]
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: i c i c 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You begin with 3d6x5 STR, so in your case you begin with 70 STR
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: then does it go down and to the right or to the right and down? 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The 70 represents your total Strength. In order to succeed with a Strength Check, you must roll under your Strength. Double click the 70 to roll a Strength Check
</p>
<p class="info">Aya c:: [ABILITY] Strength Check (70%) [Regular success] [d100 = 55]
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: ah okie it kinda works like uh
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: dark heresey 
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Exactly!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Some things are more difficult than others, like bursting through a barricaded door vs a normal door. The 35 represents the threshold for this &#34;Hard Success&#34; (1/2 your STR), and the 14 represents the threshold for an &#34;Extreme Success&#34; (1/5 of your STR)
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: ah okie 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Roll another 3d6 for your CON
</p>
<p class="info">Aya c::  [3d6 = 8]
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: 40 CON lol
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: not great!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Roll 2d6 for your SIZ and add two
</p>
<p class="gmtext">*add six
</p>
<p class="info">Aya c::  [2d6 = 5]
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: SIZ represetns your size, a combination of both height and weight. It can manifest in whichever combination you want. Your Size is 55.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">SIZ represetns your size, a combination of both height and weight. It can manifest in whichever combination you want. Your Size is 55.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Roll 3d6 for your DEX
</p>
<p class="info">Aya c::  [3d6 = 13]
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: 65!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Roll 3d6 for your APP. Appearance represents both physical attractiveness and personality, in whichever way you want it to manifest
</p>
<p class="info">Aya c::  [3d6 = 7]
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: OH NO
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: yeah that seems right
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: It's the opposite!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">INT represents intelligence, which is your quick-wittedness. Roll 2d6+6 for that
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: no no this is pretty average for me rolling a new character for the first time 
</p>
<p class="info">Aya c::  [2d6 = 5]
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: 45
</p>
<p class="gmtext">POW is your Power, your force of will and how much mental vitality you have. Roll 3d6 for that. 
</p>
<p class="info">Aya c::  [3d6 = 9]
</p>
<p class="gmtext">EDU represents book learning and formal education, stuff that's good on Jeopardy. Roll 2d6+6 for that
</p>
<p class="info">Aya c::  [2d6 = 3]
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: You'd make Star proud
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I should roll another 45
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Yup lol
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: er, well, it's another 45 for EDU there 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: yeah lol 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">And finally, roll 3d6 for your LUCK stat
</p>
<p class="info">Aya c::  [3d6 = 9]
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: lmao
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Luck is unique. Luck is used both for determining targets for monsters (sometimes) and for determining things that you don't really have any control over.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You can find the stat under the normal stats, to the far right
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Any time you make a roll, you can permanently reduce your LUCK by an amount to improve your roll by that much. This can turn a failure into a success
</p>
<p class="gmtext">As an alternative, any non-combat roll can be Pushed. If you Push a roll then you get a free reroll! However, if you fail a Pushed roll, then it counts as a Complication, which I can use to make bad things happen to you. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Your stats are, uh, noticeably below what the others have 
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Would you like a bit of a boost? lol
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: If that would be necessary otherwise I don't mind rolling with it and dying if it comes to that 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I can work with this otherwise 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Death may come for you anyways, but if you'd like you can distribute 90 points among your stats (maximum of 80 in any single skill)
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Entertainers gain a number of Occupation Skill Points equal to twice their EDU plus twice their APP, so you'll want higher values in those. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: are my skills that much noticeable lower than everyone elses ;w; 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: noticeably*
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: lol if you sum theirs up, they're at 480, 490, and 510 I think. You're at 400
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: They're all playing pregens, though
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: ahhh
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I suppose that is a bit lower then
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: and that app and edu score is a pretty big hinderance
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: I'm not gonna have my friend Aya start off on the back foot just because of luck &#62;:c
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: I'm gonna have you die fair and square by rolling like garbage!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: &#60;3
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: Thats good!
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: lol
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: okie
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I added 45 points
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: You get 45 more :3
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: okie
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I added 70 points total. I don't mind being at a slight disadvantage 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: makes me think more
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Okidoki!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Your secondary characteristics are below and to the right of your main attributes
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Hit Points are how many hit points you have. 0 is dying. If you take 5 or more at once, you suffer a Major Wound and have additional debuffs (broken leg, maimed hand, etc)
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Sanity is how mentally sound you are. Whenever you spot something supernatural, you'll roll vs your Sanity to avoid losing your cool and/or going insane
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Magic you don't gotta worry about yet
</p>
<p class="gmtext">DB is a Damage Bonus for your size and strength, which is added to melee attacks. This is represented by your Build. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Dodge we'll talk about in a bit
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Pop over to Skills here, and click the blue pencil toward the top
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: okie!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">As an Entertainer, you have Art/Craft (Acting), Disguise, Listen, and Psychology as Occupation Skills. (Psychology is Sense Motive)
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Which two Interpersonal Skills do you want to be Occupation Skills? Charm, Fast Talk, Intimidate, or Persuade?
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Also, you may choose any two other skills to have in terms of class skills
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: Interpersonal I'll probably do Charm and persuade
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: Then probably stealth and uh
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Melee attacks in this are opposed rolls. When attacked, the defender can opt to Dodge or Fight Back. If they Dodge, they only have to roll an equal level of success to the attack roll to dodge it. If they Fight Back, they have to roll one level higher, but if they win then they deal damage. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: hmm
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Oh, up at the top there's five blue options. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Ln is for selecting secondary languages. Ar for arts. Ft for fighting skills (melee). Sc for science skills. And Fr for firearm skills
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: What kind of entertainer were you?
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: probably like a vaudville assistant. The girl that gets tied to the spinning wheel and or ties crowd participants to the wheel 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: circus performer
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Pretty c:
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: actually
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I think I'll do first aid 
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Sure! :D
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Each skill starts off with a Base score. For example, Operate Heavy Machinery starts at only a 1% level of success, but you can increase that on a 1:1 basis with your 220 Occupation Points. In contrast, First Aid starts at 30% and you can do the same. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You also have 110 Personal Interest points that can be spent on anything you want
</p>
<p class="gmtext">I'd recommend to try and have at least three skills above 50% by the end of this, if not more. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: I'd recommend to try and have at least three skills above 50% by the end of this, if not more. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: You can only increase Credit Rating to 60 at max, and cannot put points into Cthulhu Mythos, but other than that it's up to you :3
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: okie
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: It's worth noting for reference that First Aid is good for stabilizing, but those injuries do need medical professionals, so you'll keep them alive as they get to a hospital
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Now you have 110 points to spend on any skills you want 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: okie dokie!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Perfect! Click the blue pen again to turn off Edit mode and we've got your skills set up
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Any time you succeed in a skill check, check off the box next to it. You have a chance at improving that skill in between adventures
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: ooo
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: Click on Inventory next
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Click on Inventory next
</p>
<p class="gmtext">In the bottom right is your Wealth. Spending Level means that you can buy anything worth under $10 and not have to record spending for it. Cash represents how much money you have on your person at any given time. And Assets represent the value of your belongings in general, stuff you could sell off for cash if you need. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">However, in general, you cna start off with any items in your inventory that you generally would have. I leave that to your discretion and reserve the right to reject it if you say you have 50 war hounds 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: lol
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Anything you *don't* put in there, you can make a Luck roll to retroactively have. As long as it's reasonable. A Luck check to see if you remembered to bring a flashlight or some rope or handcuffs
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: funnily enough I was going to say rope and handcuffs but like entertainment handcuffs so ones with a quick release 
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: You can go with whatever your character might have on them. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: can I just add that under uh
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: the top section?
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: Yup!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Your character is a member of the Society for the Exploration of the Unexplained, a club based in Boston which has a little magazine. The rest of the group just joined it and were sent out to this little town in the country, Gamwell, to collect a donation of books. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: do you want me to include everything I'd consider basic first aid individually or can I just put down like first aid kit
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: You can just do &#34;First Aid Kit&#34;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: okie dokie
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Anything reasonable that's in there is just automatically in there
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Keep in mind this is the 1920s. Also, $1 in the 1920s is about $10 in today's money
</p>
<p class="gmtext">For now, click over to the Personal tab
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There are four main parts to your character: their ideology/beliefs, significant people (past or present), meaningful locations, and treasured possessions. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: This is a list of Ideologies to roll on if you want, or you can pick one, or make one up for yourself
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: One each for Meaningful Locations and Treasured Possessions
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: And two for Significant People
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: You can roll or pick an option for each to help flesh out your character. These bonds help define your connection to Humanity, and are used to recover from the supernatural in between adventures
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: okie
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: You should also pick a name
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: the hardest part
</p>
<p class="gmtext">What you know: You've been sent out to this little town, Gamwell, to take stock of a bunch of books that the archeologist Arthur Cornthwaite is donating to the Society (SEU). He had them all delivered to their combined church/library, and you've been cataloguing them for the last day or two as more help arrives to transport them back to Boston. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: Im gonna roll on these I think 
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: All good :D
</p>
<p class="info">Aya c:: [TABLE] 2. Ideology/Beliefs =  [d10 = 4]
</p>
<p class="info">A belief in fate (e.g. karma, the class system, superstitious).
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: That makes sense actually 
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: :D
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: spends too much time with the card reader
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Ehehehehehe
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: You can add a tarot deck to your inventory if you want
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: hmmm
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I'm gonnan roll on significant people but I have an idea in mind so I might change it if I'm not a fan of the results if you're okie with that
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Absolutely!
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: The tables are here for inspiration and assistance only
</p>
<p class="info">Aya c:: [TABLE] 3a. Significant People - 1 =  [d10 = 2]
</p>
<p class="info">Grandparent (e.g. maternal grandmother, paternal grandfather).
</p>
<p class="info">Aya c:: [TABLE] 3b. Significant People - 2 =  [d10 = 7]
</p>
<p class="info">You idolize them.&#10;(e.g. for their fame, their beauty, their work).
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: yeah going with my idea
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: lol
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: spent a little too much time with the card reader :3
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: its the circus I'm sure that was allowed there in the 20s
</p>
<p class="gmtext">GM: Oh 100%, and also I don't like playing up the homophobia and racism of the 1920s so you won't find a lot of that in my sessions
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: As far as I'm concerned, 60% of 1920s US was lesbians
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: so true
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: doesn't bother me either way if people do though my pathfinder campaign I'm in takes place in the nazi devil worshipper country and I'm playing essentially a native american so 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I know how to play around it and can usually tell when people are getting weird about it 
</p>
<p class="info">Aya c:: [TABLE] 4. Meaningful Locations =  [d10 = 5]
</p>
<p class="info">A place for socializing (e.g. gentlemen's club, local bar, uncle's house).
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: lmao these dice
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: lesbians in the gentlemans club
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: hmmm

</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I just crafted a set of that for caur 
</p>
<p class="info">Aya c:: [TABLE] 5. Treasured Possessions =  [d10 = 1]
</p>
<p class="info">An item connected with your highest skill (e.g. expensive suit, false ID, brass knuckles).
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I forgot what my highest skill is
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I think its charm
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Yup!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: hmmm that could be interesting but I think I'll go with the tarot deck
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: or does that differ from regular inventory
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: It can or it could not, it's up to you. You could have a normal tarot deck you got in the store, and leave your Treasured Possession (a vintage one) back at home
</p>
