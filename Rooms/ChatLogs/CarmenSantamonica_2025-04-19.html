<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Was loading in! :D
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Last time, our group of investigators arrived in the little town of Gamwell. They discussed details on the books with the lawyers, about local going-ons with the sheriff, and about events with the newspapers. Once finding out about the old murders, the group revisited the Sheriff and found that it was he who found the massacre 30 years ago. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group's got almost all of the books, but a few special interest books don't appear to be present in those brought to the church for donation. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Oh right! He's been here for a long time omg...
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Dad's got good(ish) hearing!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">These books are: De Occulta Philosophia, The Missing People: The Tribe that the Jungle Swallowed, The Antiquities of Mexico, Secret Teachings of All Ages, and The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion
</p>
<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: Oh, hello again, Lillian. Are these your friends? 
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/LillianLovell.png" alt="Lillian Lovell"><strong>Lillian Lovell</strong>: Hello father. These fine fellows also may have an interest in your library as well. Along with some information about the house Cornthwaite lives in. 
</p>

</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Early afternoon
</p>

</p>
<p class="emote">Father Haggarty offers handshakes to all those around

<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: And yeah, that house has a history behind it. There've been a few tragedies behind it. What were you wondering?
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Lanta can I get a quick recap on what we know about the house omg I'm sorry &#62;.&#60;
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): And then the dude is missing now too. Right. 
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: We'd like to see the graves of a few specific people. The Gamwell family and the Fitzgerald family. And if you know anything about either.
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Star you're doing great omg thank you
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The Father leads the group back into the little graveyard. He leads them to two batches, one with the graves of Elma Fitzgerald (1865), Albert Fitzgerald (1865), Simon Fitzgerald (1865), and Grace Fitzgerald (1865), and then the other with the graves of Gloria Curwen (1895) and a single large tombstone for Harold, Sarah, and Susan Curwen (1895).
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The graves for Harold, Sarah, and Susan have flowers on them. 
</p>
<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: It was quite the tragedy. Ol Arthur Curwen lost his mind and killed his family. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): (Thank you lanta I did mean Curwin and Fitzgerald)
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: But they never found him?
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Aliens got him, right
</p>
<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: Right. They found Jonny Fitzgerald's body, coward shot himself. Though we don't have a tombstone for him. He's buried out back by the rock near the tree. 
</p>
<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: Curwen's been missing for... oh what's it been, like 30 years?
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Anything stand out about the graves? Is it just names and dates on them?
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Just the names and dates, and the flowers on the kids graves.

</p>
<p class="gmtext">It's a pretty quiet day out, but unfortunately there's nothing extra of note with the scene. All are graves long since buried. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl does note a shovel sitting out by a shed
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: One last thing to ask, Father, is there anything you can tell us about Arthur Cornwaite? We understand he came back from an expidition and just about isolated himself from everyone on his return?
</p>
<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: Mmmm, mostly just isolated. He's always been kind about the community, but his recent trip seems to have hit him hard. Not anything I can say directly, mind you, but... well, I do worry about him. Sometimes, in the darkest moments, we lose sight of God's Light...
</p>
<p class="emote">Father Haggarty glances down at the flowers on the graves
</p>
<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: Fortunately, Cornthwaite ain't got no kids of his own. Not that he's of that temperment, mind you

</p>
<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: No, no. It is kind of odd, he was always ordering books and picking them up in town. Books and papers and academic things
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/LillianLovell.png" alt="Lillian Lovell"><strong>Lillian Lovell</strong>: Im assuming this was through the local post office or was there someone in particular that would get these for him? 
</p>
<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: Usually just through us or the general store. Either Cornthwaite himself or one of his servants would come up to fetch them from us. 
</p>
<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: Salt?
</p>
<p class="emote">Father Haggarty blinks twice
</p>
<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: Like some salt for the kitchen?
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Flashback: The professor picks up a small slip of typed paper which has a receipt for an entire truck of salt on it; unsigned, indicating it hasn't been paid for yet. 
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: We came across an unsinged recipt for an entire truck of salt. Any idea where he would have that delivered? 
</p>
<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: I can't imagine why he'd have ordered an entire truck
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: On the occasions you saw him for a pick up, yourself, how was his demeanor? 
</p>
<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: Well usually it was pretty jovial, but he's been very subdued since his return. Only comes up here now to pick up the essentials. I think his cook quit on him, so he's taking care of all his cooking on his own. 
</p>
<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: He asked Edith for some recipes
</p>

</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarlHandy.png" alt="Carl Handy"><strong>Carl Handy</strong>: Ah.  We were remiss in telling you why we are here.  Besides picking up the books, we are looking into Arthurs seeming disappearance and hoping to find any clues as to what may have happened.

</p>
<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: I'm afraid I couldn't say. I'm just hoping he didn't opt for suicide.
</p>

</p>
<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: It did end very poorly. I'm afraid I can't say specifically, what with things being shaerd in confidence. But I think anyone who saw him would conclude the same. 
</p>
<p class="npc">Father Haggarty: Arthur Curwen, no. I wasn't living out here back then
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: It was about 30 years ago, so that doesn't surprise me.

</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): And I think we got all we could out of this sheriff.

</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): We could drive. Having Carl's truck nearby would be useful.
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): They might not know anything about why it was ordered though
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): But that's not a bad thought! We could bring it up when Lanta gets back

<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: We can introduce Lillian to the Mystery Mobile
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group piles into Carl's little truck. The back of it is full of various tools and materials for the man's carpentry. The truck's only realy made to seat two, maybe three, in the cab. It can fit all four of you if you sit kinda uncomfortably, or one or more can ride in the back.

</p>
<p class="gmtext">The trip along the road isn't too eventful, and it's not long before the group's directions lead them to the old manse. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Despite it's dark past, the Fitzgerald Estate sits in a peaceful countryside. Resting on nearly 20 acres of woodland and rolling hills, the house itself is bordered bya high stone wall topped with iron spikes. Peering through the locked gates, our intrepid investigators look upon a tangled mess of a garden, stirring in a chill autumn breeze.
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: Anyone got the key to the gates?
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: Do I?
</p>
<p class="emote">Carmen Santamonica Checks her pockets
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The iron gate providing access to the driveway is padlocked. Looking through shows the wide driveway which leads toward the house, while other ill-defined plants lead off into the rambling garden. The house is visible ahead through the riot of plant life. Unfortunately, the key ring only contains keys to the front and back door. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Oh they totally gave me the keys didn't they?

<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): We all have a 10 lol
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The main walkway up toward the house is clear, but the little side paths appear to be choked with weeds and long grasses. It's hard to tell when it was last tended, but you'd guess it's been months since anyone did gardening here. 
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/LillianLovell.png" alt="Lillian Lovell"><strong>Lillian Lovell</strong>: Carl do you have some bolt cutters?

</p>
<p class="gmtext">While the fence does have spikes up top, there's also plenty of trees growing up and over the fence. It'd be easy to climb over
</p>

</p>
<p class="gmtext">Swinging back, the lawyers are excessively apologetic about forgetting to give you the main key. They're really quite sheepish about the whole thing.
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: And that's the last one they have?
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: Back to the house then.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Heading back down to the house, the group can unlock the gate (finally) and drive their car up that quaint little driveway
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: Easy access. Easy exit.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It looks like the Fitzgerald Estate came with an extensive garden, though it's clear that Cornthwaite's gardener has not tended to it in quite some time. Stone benches, planters, and even a fountain are all choked with weeds and plants. The trees include several exotic varieties, such as willows and chery plums. It's a wild expanse of runaway foliage, aggressively overgrown. It's a dark, dank green.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house itself is silent, shuttered, and brooding. Cobwebbed by ivy, masked by trees, and caressed by the wind. It is large and apparently well-constructed, with high ceilings and thick, substantial windows, walls, and doors. From the outside, the entire edifice presents a strange, slightly skewed or tilted appearance. The foundations seem solid enough when viewed closely, but the house itself seems a little... crooked.
</p>
<p class="emote">Carmen Santamonica leads the group up to the front door, careful to avoid the overgrowth.
</p>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): in the 20s absolutely not 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house has two stories, with doors front and (presumably) back. The front door waits atop a short flight of steps. The door is carved oak, the fine brass knocker cold to the touch. The windows are potential points of entry, but are currently shuttered. 
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: Fortunately I have a key for this door as well.

</p>
<p class="gmtext">The property's foliage seems unusually green to everyone in the group. Carmen, Plato, and Handy note how thereh's a lot more leaves and foliage cover in here than there was along the route. Lillian notices mostly that the leaves keep finding their way to her face, the result of unfortunate wind gusts and Carl not checking behind him twice when he pushed vines out of the way. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The garden path circles the property, giving an angle on all sides of the house. The windows around the house are all shuttered shut. You make note of a the back door, as well as a pair of wooden hatches at the rear of the property to give access to the wood cellar.
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/LillianLovell.png" alt="Lillian Lovell"><strong>Lillian Lovell</strong>: Nature is not my friend today
</p>
<p class="gmtext">On either side of the path, greenery chokes the space and encroaches in what was once a spacious walkway. It's hard to walk down without pushing leaves out of the way. A small garden shed comes into view, green paint peeling and its door slightly ajar. Beyond it, blocking the rest of the loop, it seems a tree has finally succumb to some sort of fungal infection and fallen across. It's covered in mushrooms, which have practically burst fourth to spread through the surrounding foliage.
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: Let's check that shed.

<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Nachooooooooo!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Inside, the shed is dark, and a carpet of leaves and detritus cover the floor. There are lots of tools: rakes, a wheelbarrow, shovels, some hedge-clippers, a pick, a saw, and so on&#8212;many of these have fallen to the floor. All are disused and a little dirty, and some are a little rusty.
</p>
