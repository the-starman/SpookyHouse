<p class="gmtext">Carmen finishes tightening the mason jar full of salt, the head of the horrible little statue poking up out of it. Only one eye's visible in the salt, but a little shake makes sure that neither are visible as the salt redistributes.

<p class="gmtext">The basement is a mess, with salt and marks of the ooze splatterend all over the walls. You can see straight up from the basement to the second story balcony through the hole in the floor.

<p class="gmtext">It's curently late morning, though despite the sun being up high, the basement is still steeped in shadows. The flashlights and lamps serve to illuminate the scene, though kerchiefs are needed to cover mouths in the powder that's left floating in the air like a haze.

<p class="gmtext">Looking around the basement, it's full of oddly crushed bales of old magazines, rusty tools, formerly valuable pieces of antinque furniture, and a LOT of leftover salt. It seems that the amount of salt used down here was perhaps more than needed.

<p class="gmtext">The professor volunteers for a position on staff at the University where he helps organize, attend, and speak at various scientific conferences. It works fairly well getting in the door, but he does not strike it rich
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Professor your creativity with this is admrable
</p>
<p class="gmtext">More seriously, he obtains the fetish from Illy. He brings it into his home, setting the fetish out on the table, and waits. He creates a &#34;salt box&#34;, and sets the fetish in it (wearing gloves to avoid touching it directly). He sets it in, and it sits there. In the box. Seconds pass, then minutes.

</p>
<p class="gmtext">The professor watches it for tens of minutes, then hours, taking notes and keeping an eye on the thing. Eventually, he notices steam emitting from it, and a closer look reveals that the surface is slick now, though the base of it has sunk into the salt box as the salt reacts to the moisture. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The statue is definitely slowly dissolving its way through the bottom of the salt box
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Slowly, it melts through the salt box, with the slime eating away a small hole. As more of the salt beneath it vanishes, it's able to pool into a small puddle, and continues to ooze. By this point, dusk has fallen, and the professor's eyes are heavy with exhaustion. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Professor needs a more scientific approach
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The professor pours in a bunch of salt, and there's a pop and crackle as the salt cancels out all the slime. He boxes it back up for the night, and continues his research like this.

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Over the course of weeks and months, he's able to ascertain a few things. First, the salt in the mason jar seems to prevent it from even generate slime. Second, it's very consistent in how much of the slime it creates at a time. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Pouring in a slurry of food, the creature does seem to absorb and begin to consume it. However, the professor is not willing to let it grow overnight, limiting his growth in knowledge to just the fact that it will slowly consume things like sugar, meat, and food slurries. It grows a little faster with the food, but not a lot. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">He does not get any signs of conscious recognition. It seems to respond very predictably, and does not respond to non-food and non-salt stimuli other than to slowly try to climb it. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It does not form any mouths nor eyes, instead remaining a semi-transparent liquid.
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): This is getting out of hand...
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato obtains several jars of the goop from the slime. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Pouring the slime on the meat, it doesn't seem to do anything. Even after a few hours, it hasn't really dissolved it. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Unless placed on salt, it seems to be chemically innert. With the salt, it still bubbles and boils away
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): So the statue itself is generating and controlling the goo
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Goop jars...
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Hmmmm
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It's toward the tail end of his experiments that he begins plant experiments, growing several tomato plants and giving them different amounts of the slime as fertilizer. It's a STAGGERING difference, with the slime seeming to increase the growth dramatically and giving large, ripe, delicious looking tomatos.

<p class="gmtext">Tomatos typically develop their fruit over the course of 60-90 days. The well gooped tomatos are making fruit after only 2-3 weeks, and they're really good looking. Very healthy plants.

<p class="gmtext">Looking into the immortality, Carmen slowly works out the details for *how*. It requires cross referencing and details, decoding parts of seemingly-nonsensical phrases, she obtains a phrase which can be said with power. This is what Corbitt used as a basis for his immortality, drawing out the fortune from other individuals and converting it into fortitude. With this spell, Carmen is confident that she could draw out the life forces of someone else and replenish her *own* fortune.
