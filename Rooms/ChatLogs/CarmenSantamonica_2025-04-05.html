</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking through the papers, the group find occasional mentions of Cornthwaite. It's harder to keep track of them all than it is to find them. But none are particularly interesting. THey talk about opening fetes, attening tea parties, donating to the church, winning at a local bridge night, giving books to the church/library, and so on. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Less than helpful

<p class="gmtext">Chatting with Sam, there doesn't seem to be much about Arthur. He seems omnipresent in the little town, but at the same time he seems distant. The conversation drifts away from him and goes to the house, which apparently has a bit of a history. 
</p>
<p class="npc">Sam Artemis: Yeah, they call it the Fitzgerald Manse because that's the name of the guy who offed himself and his family there
</p>
<p class="npc">Sam Artemis: Was right after the civil war

<p class="npc">Sam Artemis: There was another guy... oh I dont remember, like thirty years ago? Also killed his family there as well, though the cops didn't catch him

</p>
<p class="emote">Sam Artemis rummages through the archives with the group for a bit
</p>
<p class="npc">Sam Artemis: The other one I'm not as sure of, but you're welcome to look through if you'd like (with another Library Use roll)

<p class="npc">Sheriff Whitford: I remember every night. Arthur Curwen killed his family
</p>
<p class="emote">Carmen Santamonica takes the seat in front of the man.

<p class="npc">Sheriff Whitford: He got away back then, but I hope he's still aliveI hope he's still alive somewhere, because I'm looking forward to shooting the bastard down like the dog that he is.

</p>
<p class="gmtext">Thinking back, Lillian recalls something else that the pastor had mentioned in passing: &#34;Poor man's been struggling with his guilt for months now.&#34; When pressed on this, he seemed a bit sheepish and said he couldn't say anything more, shouldn't have said that much. What's told in confession is intended to be in confidence, after all.
