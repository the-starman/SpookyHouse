</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Got it!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">He mentions his house many times, which he refers to by the Anglo-French &#34;desmesne&#34; most of the time. Throughout, the notes mention times when he had to provide favors owed from when he claimed the house, and details (quite bitterly) what resources were spent. They're phrased in terms of either time spent, power granted for some purpose, or in gibberish-like names. They're always granted to abbreviations, not to full names. Example: &#34;broke another shell of the Opener in exchange for A.W.'s aid. One left.&#34; followed by scratchings of &#34;hate him&#34; or &#34;Sent the shambler to M.T., debt paid&#34;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">He talks about his &#34;immortality&#34;. Not how he achieved it, but of its tragedy. He rambles about the neighborhood no longer providing enough &#34;fortune&#34; to feed his spells and curses &#34;Thomas&#34; for it. He seems to be overtaken by madness, many of the notes being incoherent scratches or scribbles for periods of time.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">He talks about his athame, the ritual dagger. He talks about sporadic sacrifices; cats, rats, and attempted human sacrifices to lift himself from his fugue. Even with his athame supposedly &#34;streamlining the transfer of blood to power&#34;, it's never enough.
</p>
<p class="emote">Carmen Santamonica eyes the dagger warily 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">And throughout, he talks more and more about the rats. He workshops a way to use a medallion he procured to funnel &#34;the whispers of Khnum&#34;, which allowed him to control rats, bugs, and other vermin. He complains about its lack of finesse, but there's enough here to detail how to enact this yourself if you have the dagger and medallion.
</p>
<p class="emote">Carmen Santamonica: As unluck would have it, she still has both...
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): In the office safe when she's not examining/studying it 
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): This isn't instructions, it's vague notions of what could be done with these instruments?
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Unlike the Book of Eibon, which seemed to have a breakdown on how to cast its spell, Carmen feels she'd have to put together the spell. It's something she could try to put together in the future, re-reading the book with the intent to learn more about the inner workings of Corbitt's magic.

<p class="gmtext">A couple weeks later, the group receive letters in the mail. Enclosed is a letter from the Society for the Exploration of the Unexplained requesting your aid in transferring books back to Boston. Additionally, they included a copy of the letter they received from the original client.

<p class="gmtext">According the SEU's addendum, they expect this to take probably two days, one to get out there and assess the books and then another to head back. They're planning to book you for the weekend, though, getting you out there Friday and then heading back Sunday.
