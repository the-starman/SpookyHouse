<p class="gmtext">Having made it out of their subterranian prison with the help of Mr Lye, the group has returned to their homes and families. They now sit at a table together with the predicament: the things they've found down in the tunnels are very much real. The massive organ, the temple, the whole colony of pygmy people deep beneath Boston.

Spreading across the far wall is a bizarre, twisted structure fashioned from interlaced bronze pipes and studded with crystals of various sizes and colors. The pipes pierce the wall in numerous places while the other ends ultimately end in spikes. There is a rock formation 20 feet in front of it, carved into a sort of chair, though, its curving seat and back aren't comfortable for humans.

Their eyelids are closed, and their mouths and the muscles of their throats move as they sing.
