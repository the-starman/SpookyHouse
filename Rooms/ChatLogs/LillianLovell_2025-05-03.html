<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Carmen can walk in and explain to Lillian and Plato 
</p>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): yeah probabliy not at this poitn 
</p>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): yeah he doesn't have the axe
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong></p></div><div><p class="player">So, he seems harmless enough. His name is Joe. He's from the local press.
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p> </p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">GM: Just a quick announcement here: I got some feedback from y'all, and I want to adjust how we do our exploration and fact-finding. 
</p></div></div>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): WELL, I think we DID decide on that first thing, I don't remember if there was a consensu on the second part
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p> </p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">GM: One common point is that there's a bit of difficulty with order of actions and with more tension. So to address those I want to implement Turns, similar to OD&#38;D
</p></div></div>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yeah okay that would make sense!
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p> </p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">GM: One Turn is 30min, and allows you to do a thorough search. You can do a sped up search in 15min if you accept +1P (one penalty die) for your roll. Spending a Turn looking things over suggests a more thorough investigation than just glancing around. 
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p> </p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">GM: This will both ensure that all four players are able to do something (rather than one player getting accidentally steamrolled) and also put a bit of a cost on your searches
</p></div></div>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): that makes sense
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p> </p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">GM: You could all spend a Turn searching Cornthwaite's room, but that means we go from 4:00pm to 4:30pm. If you all fail, you can do it again, but then it goes from 4:30pm to 5:00pm
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p> </p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">GM: This should also encourage splitting up, since reasonably you don't need four of you doing a search in one room to expect at least one success
</p></div></div>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): ...With how we roll?
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p> </p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">GM: Though if you want to, you absolutely can, it'll just take twice as long
</p></div></div>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Either or would be fine with me based on GM feeling for the situation
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p> </p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">GM: If you have two or more people searching a room, you can split the work up to make it go faster. One person checks one half, and the other person checks the other half, and it takes half as long. BUT, if someone misses their roll on the upper half, y'all may miss information that is hidden their (ie the secret fireplace)
</p></div></div>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): This is making logical sense and helping to bridge the dice and real world. I like it!
</p>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): I'm not carmen is 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group gathers up on the upper balcony, with a new addition of a Mr Joe Virelli. Carmen catches the Professor and Lillian up as they join in. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p> </p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>Joe Virelli</strong></p></div><div><p class="npc">So, you're all looking for books, was it? And Arthur?

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Y'all know that Joe's been with the Gamwell Gazette for probably 10 years, or at least he's been writing articles for them for that long. You had to go through a lot of his stuff when looking for facts about Cornthwaite
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): And the major events of the house were 30 and 60 years ago
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Professor do you want to interrogate Joe?

Is there some lead you're following up on?
</p></div></div>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Who's Joe asking?
</p>
<p class="emote">Lillian Lovell Points to herself &#34;me?&#34;
</p>

I was checking the property, I figured he might've tripped and fallen or something, but no sign of any bodies out there. I found the axe sorta tossed by the wayside, though. It'd been out there long enough to get sticky with something, but wasn't rusted or anything
</p></div></div>

</p>
<p class="gmtext">Inside, gathering dust, are loot from tombs the world over: pots, vases, statuettes, carvings, musical instruments, idols, and more. Some seem to leer and snicker at you in the gloom. A couple have already been smashed into unrecognizable fragments. All stare with painted outrage, flat eyes hostile to the men who removed them from their ancestral homes. Sitting on a propped up spot is a leather-bound book; De Occulta Philosophia etched in the front.

<p class="gmtext">Looking through the artifacts, the Professor can't spot any that were added recently. There's a few spots open, as if room was left open for them, but the dust on them indicate that nothing had ever been placed here. It seems like Cornthwaite didn't put anything in here after his last trip, and maybe hadn't even been in here in months. 
</p>
<p class="whisper"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: He chats about it, and a lot of what he says conveys the same sort of thing that you've heard from the priest. Cornthwaite seemed really skittish after his trip, and Joe describes him as having lost his old cheer that he'd had
</p>
<p class="whisper">Lillian Lovell: I'll ask him if the house had always been kinda decrepit or does it seem like it decayed faster than it should have
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl notices that there's a rack for a rifle or shotgun. It's empty at the moment, its gun missing in action. There's also an empty box of cartridges for a shotgun.

<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Star I appreciate your observations!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">(To add to the Professor's roll): While it looks like none of the trophies have been dusted or touched, there are some light signs of other presence. Of particular note, it does look like someone went into the drawyer for the box of bullets, and relatively recently.

<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Brb drink refill :'D
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen steps around the other side, parallel to Lillian. She steps around the edge, looking toward the far side where the box fell. She can see it, some of the clutter having fallen away, and she can see something behind it
</p>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): :&#62; :&#62; :&#62;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Enormous and bloated, a swell of green substance rises from the floor. A nightmareish mass of abhorrent corruption, a bubbling morass of translucent greenish gel in which swirl air pockets, and sickly pus-like matter. Ghastly pink mouths and bloated black eye-like organs slowly form along the surface, gaping and blinking in and out of existence. But she can tell one locks eyes with her. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Is there a window up here I can jump out of
</p>
<p class="gmtext">What she doesn't see is the swell to her left, oozing out of the boards just behind her head, another tendral of the thing which lashes out and grabs her.
