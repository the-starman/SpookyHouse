<p class="gmtext">The heavy rain outside really just adds to the atmosphere of the little house. Fortunately, Carl and the trio he'd brought with him had managed to get the flooring out of the truck before the downpour started. Not the tools, but Old Man McGregor told'm that he could just use his old tools and such in the basement. He had a crowbar for sure, and probably a few more things down there.

<p class="gmtext">The three who he'd brought with him were Kazie, Roscoe, and Thomas. Kazie was a black girl in overalls and thick gloves, more than willing to get in it with the rest of the lot. Roscoe was a scrawny lad with bottle glasses. Thomas was the youngest of the bunch, maybe only 14, but was bigger than most kids his size and had the telling shock of red hair.
