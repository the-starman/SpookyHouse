</p>
<strong><p class="npc">Mr Knott</strong>: So, I've brought the lot of you here because I have a task for you. I picked up his house through my sister-in-law, but it's in awful condition. 
</p>
<strong><p class="npc">Mr Knott</strong>: I tried hiring out to get it fixed up, but none of the workers want anything to do with it because of these STUPID rumors. So I want you three to look into it. 
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarlHandy.png" alt="Carl Handy"><strong>Carl Handy</strong>: Uh, I don't mean to pry Mr Knott but I'm not much for social circles.  What rumors?
</p>
<p class="emote">Carmen Santamonica pulls a notepad and pen from her jacket and starts to jot down notes
</p>
<strong><p class="npc">Mr Knott</strong>: A bunch of superstitious nonsense. My wife's cousin had a mental break a few years ago and everyone's attributing it to some dumb curse. We're in Boston, not Egypt!

</p>
<strong><p class="npc">Mr Knott</strong>: Which is why I want you there as well, Professor Plato. You're a history guy, if you say the house hasn't had any Indian burial grounds on it then maybe people will forget about this
</p>
<strong><p class="npc">Mr Knott</strong>: It's nothing specific, they just attribute all the bad stuff with curses in general. I fell down the stairs when trying to fix the railing and they called it the curse. 
</p>
<p class="emote">Mr Knott gestures down at his leg with his cane
</p>
<strong><p class="npc">Mr Knott</strong>: I figure you'd probably have the know-how to figure out more recent history with it, Ms Santamonica
</p>

</p>
<p class="emote">Carl Handy: Looks about trying to spot the broken railing.
</p>
<strong><p class="npc">Mr Knott</strong>: Anyways, I've got $25 for each of you upfront. $20 more if you're done before 9am Monday, I want to get this thing moving

</p>
<p class="emote">Carmen Santamonica reaches out for the envelope.
</p>

</p>
<strong><p class="npc">Mr Knott</strong>: Ah but leave the kids out of this. My wife would kill me, the whole thing is incredibly upsetting to them

</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: Understandably, sir. Anything more you can share about the house? Age, size, number of rooms...?
</p>
<strong><p class="npc">Mr Knott</strong>: Oh I have no idea on the age, it's pretty old though. Oldest on the street, I think. Four rooms on the first floor, four on the second, plus the bathroom. Small basement.
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: Attic or crawl space?
</p>

</p>

</p>

Poor kids, a family falling apart like that...I'll do my best to give you an honest appraisal of the state of the house.  Besides the railing you mentioned are there any areas of particular concern?

<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I think that's part of the investigation! :D
</p>
<p class="player">GM: It seems that Knott is under the impression it could just be anything, but you can check out what happened to his sister-in-law for more details. Either the old news papers in the Library or going directly to the source at the Sanitarium.

Carl, if you'd be a dear and help the good Professor, I'll ask the staff if there's anything they can share.
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: For every 6 hours spent researching, each player can make a Library Use roll to sift through and find details on the house. If you're looking for something specific, let me know and you may get a Bonus Die to narrow it down. It's about 10am when you arrive.

</p>
<p class="player">GM: Pretty much. A &#34;turn&#34; for research is 6 hours, so instead of rolling your own die you helped boost the Professor's
</p>
<p class="player">GM: Correct, Illy. The staff is going to help you look into stuff, so you get a +1B too
</p>
<p class="player">GM: You can, but if you do research for 3 hours you'll get a Penalty die, the opposite of a Bonus die

</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Just like magnets
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Which door do you want?
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Top left door
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Good job Hawu!
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: You can if you click their tokens, I think
</p>
<p class="player">GM: Over to the right
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I saw it
</p>
<p class="player">GM: Deselect yourself for a moment
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The door opens up to a kid's room, a small room with a single bed. Childrens' toys sit around, long since abandoned. Up to the north end of the room is the window, dusty and grimey, and a half-open door to a closet. 
</p>
<p class="player">GM: You can flick them on, yes
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: Good idea Carl!
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Window goofballs
</p>
<p class="player">GM: Fun fact, this is a real floorplan from the 1920s
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): &#34;A lotta feet&#34; is a unit of measurement
</p>
<p class="player">GM: You can if you rub it clean
</p>
<p class="player">GM: Hawu just experienced a segfault
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD
</p>
<p class="emote">Carl Handy: walks to the window and tries to rub the grime off with his rag.
</p>
<p class="player">GM: Either or
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I like to take actions and let the GM tell me what happens as a result
</p>
<p class="player">GM: I like it, it confirms that you've made a decision
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Hey you had one
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Wiping the window clean, Carl looks out to the back yard. There's not much to see, given that the property is boxed up in between taller buildings, but he can see the little dead yard. Nobody outside.
</p>
<p class="player">GM: Want into the closet? 
</p>

</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): We don't know that though!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The closet is small and cramped, clothing missing from the hangers. The floorboards in the corner are rotted through, and you can see a hole which may have once been used by a rat. 
</p>
<p class="player">GM: Would you like to reach into it?
</p>
<p class="player">GM: Wanna describe it or do you want me to?
</p>

</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Dalge drank the rest of my rum :(
</p>
<p class="emote">Carl Handy: gets on his hands and knees and peers into the hole as best he can.
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Because Dalge drank it &#62;:T (I drank most of it tho)
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yes! I room with one of my best friends from snice middle school and his gf! :D
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Driven??
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl leans down to peer into the hole and sees right out the other side. It looks like this little section of wall has largely been cleared out of insulation. Rat droppings and scratch marks indicate what did it. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Excuse you both, this is by choice
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You can actually see down toward the first floor from here

<p class="gmtext">Two beds sit in this room, along with a large wardrobe. Again, another closet, and a number of dolls that someone had pointed at the door for some reason. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): No realtion to the big red hat
</p>
<p class="gmtext">A bathroom containing a sink, bathtub and a water closet with an overhead tank. Towels and other possessions are still here, typical to a family of four. A brackish pool of water has collected in the bathtub. A single bubble rises to the surface of the opaque water.
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Professional respect and &#34;Same name&#34; instead of &#34;Same hat&#34;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">This room contains a bed frame, bare bedsprings and a dresser. Though unused, this room looks like the other bedrooms.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">An ordinary bedroom, with a double bed, bookshelf and window view. Apparently the room of Vittorio and Gabriela. The room is positively covered in crosses, with several bibles sitting along the book shelves. Beads from a rosary, long since broken, lie scattered across the floor.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">In none of the rooms do the group find signs of anyone... except...

<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): DON&#34;T GO DOWN THERE
</p>
<p class="gmtext">As the group of you discuss upstairs, something thumps from downstairs. You all hear it, and the lights flicker alongside a second thump. There, standing in between the three of you for just a moment as the light flickers, is a man.
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): WOAH
