<p class="gmtext">Wiping the window clean, Carl looks out to the back yard. There's not much to see, given that the property is boxed up in between taller buildings, but he can see the little dead yard. Nobody outside.

<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): We don't know that though!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The closet is small and cramped, clothing missing from the hangers. The floorboards in the corner are rotted through, and you can see a hole which may have once been used by a rat. 
</p>
<p class="whisper"> -&#62; Professor Plato: You hear a thump from the dining room, as if something heavy just fell down over there.

<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Driven??
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl leans down to peer into the hole and sees right out the other side. It looks like this little section of wall has largely been cleared out of insulation. Rat droppings and scratch marks indicate what did it.

<p class="whisper">Professor Plato: follow the noise
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Professor you should answer our good handyman
</p>
<p class="whisper"> -&#62; Professor Plato: Turning your flashlight on, you head out to the hallway. You could swear you heard someone walk down the stairs. Looking down, the stairwell makes a turn partway down, preventing you from seeing the basement from here.

</p>
<p class="gmtext">This room contains a bed frame, bare bedsprings and a dresser. Though unused, this room looks like the other bedrooms.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">An ordinary bedroom, with a double bed, bookshelf and window view. Apparently the room of Vittorio and Gabriela. The room is positively covered in crosses, with several bibles sitting along the book shelves. Beads from a rosary, long since broken, lie scattered across the floor.
