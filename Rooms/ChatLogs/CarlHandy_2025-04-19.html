<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Was loading in! :D
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Last time, our group of investigators arrived in the little town of Gamwell. They discussed details on the books with the lawyers, about local going-ons with the sheriff, and about events with the newspapers. Once finding out about the old murders, the group revisited the Sheriff and found that it was he who found the massacre 30 years ago. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group's got almost all of the books, but a few special interest books don't appear to be present in those brought to the church for donation. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Oh right! He's been here for a long time omg...

</p>
<p class="gmtext">Despite it's dark past, the Fitzgerald Estate sits in a peaceful countryside. Resting on nearly 20 acres of woodland and rolling hills, the house itself is bordered bya high stone wall topped with iron spikes. Peering through the locked gates, our intrepid investigators look upon a tangled mess of a garden, stirring in a chill autumn breeze.

<p class="gmtext">The iron gate providing access to the driveway is padlocked.

Unfortunately, the key ring only contains keys to the front and back door.

<p class="gmtext">It looks like the Fitzgerald Estate came with an extensive garden, though it's clear that Cornthwaite's gardener has not tended to it in quite some time. Stone benches, planters, and even a fountain are all choked with weeds and plants. The trees include several exotic varieties, such as willows and chery plums. It's a wild expanse of runaway foliage, aggressively overgrown. It's a dark, dank green.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house itself is silent, shuttered, and brooding. Cobwebbed by ivy, masked by trees, and caressed by the wind. It is large and apparently well-constructed, with high ceilings and thick, substantial windows, walls, and doors. From the outside, the entire edifice presents a strange, slightly skewed or tilted appearance. The foundations seem solid enough when viewed closely, but the house itself seems a little... crooked.
</p>
<p class="emote">Carmen Santamonica leads the group up to the front door, careful to avoid the overgrowth.
</p>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): in the 20s absolutely not 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house has two stories, with doors front and (presumably) back. The front door waits atop a short flight of steps. The door is carved oak, the fine brass knocker cold to the touch. The windows are potential points of entry, but are currently shuttered.

<p class="gmtext">The property's foliage seems unusually green to everyone in the group. Carmen, Plato, and Handy note how thereh's a lot more leaves and foliage cover in here than there was along the route. Lillian notices mostly that the leaves keep finding their way to her face, the result of unfortunate wind gusts and Carl not checking behind him twice when he pushed vines out of the way. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The garden path circles the property, giving an angle on all sides of the house. The windows around the house are all shuttered shut. You make note of a the back door, as well as a pair of wooden hatches at the rear of the property to give access to the wood cellar.

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">On either side of the path, greenery chokes the space and encroaches in what was once a spacious walkway. It's hard to walk down without pushing leaves out of the way. A small garden shed comes into view, green paint peeling and its door slightly ajar. Beyond it, blocking the rest of the loop, it seems a tree has finally succumb to some sort of fungal infection and fallen across. It's covered in mushrooms, which have practically burst fourth to spread through the surrounding foliage.

<p class="gmtext">Inside, the shed is dark, and a carpet of leaves and detritus cover the floor. There are lots of tools: rakes, a wheelbarrow, shovels, some hedge-clippers, a pick, a saw, and so on&#8212;many of these have fallen to the floor. All are disused and a little dirty, and some are a little rusty.
