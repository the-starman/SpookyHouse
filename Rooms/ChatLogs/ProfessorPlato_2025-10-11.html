<p class="gmtext">As Carl and Jackson pull up the soaked furs to use on the incense, tossing them over their shoulders, they're interrupted by a sound at the door. Over a dozen of the pale pygmy people stand in the entryway, holding various rock tools with sharp ends on them. In the back, with a dirty fur draped over uncomfortably long limbs, is an aparent leader. It raises one hand and says something in a strange language, and the group of cave dwellers raise their weapons and approach slowly.
</p>
<p class="emote">Carmen Santamonica draws her gun and fires a single shot to the side of the leader's head, making sure not to hit any of the others.

<p class="emote">The Crowd freezes what they're doing, backing up. The leader ducks lower, behind the group, and seems to scamper back. She says something, and when the group of pygmies moves backward, says it again more angrily, but they remain where they are.

<p class="gmtext">The crowd of pygmies looks up at Lillian as she approaches with the box of raisins. She holds it up and demonstrates, eating one, before offering it forward.

<p class="gmtext">Some of the pygmies stay behind, and seem to be gathering things from the lair. The rest come with you, following behind as you make your way through narrow tunnels that require you to travel in single file lines and sometimes stoop.

<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): ewoks
</p>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Does anyone remember that movie where some serial killer guy had to kill off the personalities in his head to try and narrow down which personality was the serial killer
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The smaller tunnels are still illuminated by fungus, though in this area they begin to have small capped outgrowths which seem to pull the veinous webbings of the fungus out of the ground. They still glow enough to see, though perhaps these pygmy people can see better than y'all can. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: No, but that sounds FASCINATING
</p>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): nah its from a while ago
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Eventually, you make it to a large, tall chamber, maybe 3-4 stories in height. There is no fungus lighting this chamber up, and instead a large blue flame sits in the center, smokeless and providing enough light to cast long shadows across the room. The outer walls are covered in caves, with pygmy people looking out over you as you enter. In addition to smaller personal caves which you'd struggle to fit into comfortably, there are a few larger, more pronounced tunnels like the one you emerged from.

<p class="gmtext">And then of course you have half a dozen other larger tunnels in the room, some higher up than others and requiring a bit of a climb. The room is filled with the sound of crackling fire and soft murmurs of their speech.

<p class="gmtext">Carmen approaches the fire, and almost has a shiver. The blaze in front of her doesn't even let out heat, but she can feel a sort of pressure against her from it that paradoxically seems to draw her forward. She can see one of the pygmies up near it, reaching in with a large stone shaft to prod something deep within. Unlike the others near here, its eyes are glazed over with cataracts that likely leave it blind, and it's significantly more active than the others who simply sit idly and watch the flame. They don't even react as Carmen approaches.

<p class="gmtext">Carl climbs up to investigate some of the higher caves, getting a good look inside. The caves are not natural, but they don't look man-made either.
