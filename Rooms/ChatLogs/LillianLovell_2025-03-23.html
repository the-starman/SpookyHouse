<p class="gmtext">The group is left in silence, breathing heavy. Everyone's hearts are racing. Carl's eyes hurt from having been rolled up into his head for too long. The main basement's junk pile has a little path carved through it from where things had been moved out of the way. A hole has been torn into the wooden wall separating the main basement from this small, secret alcove. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">On the floor, a smear of ash is all that remains from the withered body that was once Walter Corbitt. Atop and within it sit the chain and medalion. A table, almost more of an altar, sits in the center of the room. On the far side of the room is a small bookshelf, full of loose-leaf paper, a couple vials, and a few other objects.

<p class="gmtext">On the front side, a mother seats to the right on a stone, holding a child in the right arm, before it is another child leaned on it and holds the hand begging to the mother. Across the top is written &#34;O GIEB MIR BROD MICH HUNGERT&#34;. Along the bottom is &#34;IETTON&#34;, at the foot of the stone, &#34;Stettner&#34;.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">On the reverse side, the cloud hangs a balance. A scale measures a bag on the left, labeled 1 &#38; 3L below it. On the right is  stone, 12.KR below it. Between the bowls is IMAAS BIER 8&#189; KR. On the state line is an anchor and a sheaf grain, left and right, grain clusters. Caption: VERZAGET NICHT - GOTT OR LEBET NOCH.

<p class="gmtext">The box itself is plain on the outside, but inscriptions are present on the inside. Carmen has to travel up to New York to talk to an expert in Greek history. Ida Steele meets with her, and gives her a rough translation of the text: &#34;From Tartarus to Elysium, from the Earth to the Heavens, may your Hermes protect you on your journey&#34;

</p>
<p class="player">GM: Is that style of exposition okay with you, Illy? I didn't ask how you were looking into these, which I probably should have
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yes yes!
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Please go on!!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The little black stone is odd. When rotating it, it seems to change shape subtly, which you only notice when you were holding it and turned to do something and felt it shift in your hand. It's always uncomfortably cold, as if it had been in a refrigerator. Did you want to take it to any particular experts?

</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): That's what I want to know!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen seeks out some geologists at Miskatonic University. Professor Julian Gallagher checks it out, but is quite puzzled by it. He can't identify the type of stone it is, though he is pretty sure it's crystalline rather than being a stone. It seems to have a hollow space within it, though it's empty given the sensation when shaken. 
</p>
<p class="emote">Carmen Santamonica thanks the Professor and tries with any known spiritualists or antique experts
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Since it seems to be part of a set maybe it's something famous or important?
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Antique experts are also pretty baffled by it. It's not something any of them have heard of before, not even with context of the box, though they do offer to buy it off of Carmen. Known mediums are even worse, the &#34;spiritualists&#34; keep saying it has something to do with Carmen's mother, or her future lover, or her dog (some are worse than the others). 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The professor has no problem getting started on his reading with the book. He's able to give it a proper read this time, though, and this is a bit more unnerving. Roll SAN.

<p class="gmtext">The professor makes it through about half of the notes in the book. It tells the story of the wizard Eibon and his strange travels, and he has to constantly reference different lores from the Greeks, the Egyptians, the Sumerians, and the people of Ur. (He gains 5 more Cthulhu Mythos)
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The copy is hand written and incomplete, leaving most of the wizard's methods and stories incomplete. But one in particular is complete, and that's one where he calls upon the Opener of Ways.

</p>
<p class="gmtext">This is a ritual which requires a circle to be etched in the ground and filled with water, and it gives an image of the diagram to sketch. It requires a &#34;pure blade of iron or copper, not of brass&#34;. The ritual itself, judging from how many times you have to repeat the incantation, probably requires an hour and a half at least to cast properly, though Eibon does it in half that time (and is said to be amazing for it). 
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Is said to be amazing for it
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Fast chanter
</p>
<p class="gmtext">In the story, the Opener of Ways appears and carries Eibon to the dreams of another where he may converse with the man, and then carries him back. Other worlds pass before his eyes, though, and the thought sends shivers up the professor's spione. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Carmen would try it
</p>
<p class="player">GM: Professor Plato gains the spell &#34;Call the Opener of Ways&#34;. This spell will cost Magic Points to cast (you can see them near your hit points). If you don't have enough magic points, then it will draw from your Hit Points after your MP is expended. Casting such a spell will also take a toll on your Sanity (no roll to avoid). 
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): In Bloodborne we call that gaining Insight

<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD That's really funny!!
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Can we do it as a group?
</p>
<p class="gmtext">When asking about with the professors, none of the main staff seem familiar with this topic (though you could work to recruit one). Eventually, you stumble across Professor Henry Armitage, the head librarian. The man seems positively spooked when it's brought up, and practically pleads with Professor Plato to end his investigations. &#34;Nothing good can come of this, it's better locked away in the restricted section.&#34;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">When dealing with the Opener of Ways, it does say that &#34;... with his forceful will, he directed the Opener of Ways to carry him&#34;

<p class="gmtext">Carl sets up his plan to expand his business. Without the proper funds to finance it, he does the most reasonable alternative to taking out a loan: orphans. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): But there are children
</p>
<p class="gmtext">They're not a proper lot, but Carl's able to draw in the interest of several of the homeless and foster kids, teens and young adults. He lays the law down HARD, though, kicking out the troublemakers and getting the rules across with an even hand. The numbers naturally dwindle over time, always cycling in and out as they find the work not to their taste or as they find employment elsewhere. But even after four months, he's still got three regulars coming to him in addition to occasional new-comers.
