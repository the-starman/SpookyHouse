<p class="gmtext">Blood slowly pools out around the reptilian form, leaking from the hedge trimmers embedded in the creature's neck. Its lidless eyes, speckled with salt, stare up unfocused. Lucille clings to Carl, still in shock, and the Professor still lays twitching on the ground, blisters across his face and hands, in too much pain to do more than groan.

<p class="gmtext">Pulling out and testing a few of the papers out, none of them are legible. The script that's present is one that Carl's never seen before, but Carmen recognizes it. The script is the same as the type that she saw when researching the black box found in the basement of the house. There were several suggestions for what the decorative symbols indicated, with some saying it was the lost continent of Mu while others pointed to Atlantis or extraterrestrials. But with what's been found down here, she realizes that this script is Aklo, a pre-human tongue.

<p class="gmtext">By this point, Lillian's noticed that the professor's hands and face aren't as ba as they were earlier. Whatever effect was on him seems to be fading now, and he's left groaning on the floor in the aftermath. It doesn't quite go back to normal, though; light scarring remains behind, and in the light of the lanterns it looks vaguely scale-like.

<p class="gmtext">As Carl, Carmen, and the Professor grab some papers and scrolls, the camera pans back up to the house. In one of the guest bedrooms upstairs, a single bowl full of greens, breads, and some salami sits in front of one of the vents. The vent covering has been torn off, leaving it open. Lillian's head peeks up from behind the bed. Beside her, the heads of Roscoe, Lucille, and Betty raise up as well to peek over at the bait.

It's in the cupboard, pulling out and opening food before tasting it and throwing it aside.

<p class="gmtext">The creature tosses another jar, which rolls over towards Lillian. It seems to have found some sunglasses somewhere and put them on.
