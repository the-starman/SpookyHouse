<p class="gmtext">The group awakens deep underground, in a more shallow cave than before. The walls here are made of dirt and mud, and looking closely they're carved out of the walls with clawes rather than with tools. They're barely tall enough for Carl to stand upright.

<p class="emote">The Librarian leads the group through the narrow tunnel, until it finally opens up to a massive cavern.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Above, the cave roof seems to have broken away, but the sky above is a shifting overcast light, with what seem to be streams of moonlight streaking through to light up the room. To the right side, twisted trees have taken root and fill the chamber, while the left side is full of crags and rocks that are teeming with rats. On the far side of the chasm, embedded in the wall, are the remains of what looks like an old castle tower.

<p class="gmtext">The ledge that the group uses to pass by the field of rats is narrow, and the rocks cragged. To the left, it dips down,and in that dip it's filled up with rats. They seem to shrink away from the Librarian as he approaches, giving the group a brief respite as they keep up with him. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: There is only room for one at a time, though, and the last few will be cutting it close. Which order are you going in?

</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group makes their way over, and about halfway through there's a low rumble which fills the cavern. The rats, already restless against one another, become doubly so, and the Librarian hisses softly at the ones near him. They back off, but the ones behind him don't.

</p>
<p class="gmtext">From behind you, the rats that had been pooled into the ground come alive. They hiss and bite at each other, squirming and writhing before they begin to move as a large flood. They swam out from behind first, with the Librarian clearing the way in the front, pushing his way through the little crowd with claws and teeth.

<p class="gmtext">Both Jackson and Silvia slip as they run, the rats clawing at their legs. They both stagger, far more than you'd expect from rats scampering onto them. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: Would anyone like to catch them? 
</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: And by anyone, I guess I mean the professor and Lillian
</p>

</p>
<p class="ooc">GM: You can, though Carl can't get up there to help if you do
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Due to the order, any two of you can help him up. But you've got to be somewhat adjacent, if you don't want to do a DEX check to rearrange

<p class="gmtext">Lillian reaches down, and with the help of the professor's grip on his tie is able ot pull him up quickly. It's so fast, in fact, that one of the rats on his face gets catapulted down the cliff as he's yoinked upright. They barely had a few moments with him, but his face and hands are scratched up pretty badly.
