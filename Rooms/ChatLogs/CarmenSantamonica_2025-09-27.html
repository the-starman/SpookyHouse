<p class="gmtext">The new &#34;guest&#34; to the group, a small and pasty-white humanoid, gets its fill pretty quickly. It's barely dressed, with only a leathery sort of shawl around its lower half. Its eyes are a bit larger than one might expect, its hair greasy and cut short, and its teeth jaged and unaligned.

<p class="gmtext">The group debates and discusses as the incense pours out. It seems to linger around the statue itself, not actually making it over to the entryway where the new guests linger. Deciding against it, they back away and make their way toward their old lizardy friend.

<p class="gmtext">The group is picking up and loading the furs into the water, soaking them through so they can use it to block out the incense. As they're doing so, however, they hear a sound. Glancing to the left, the group sees a dozen or so of the pygmy people standing in the entryway holding various rock tools. In the back, with a dirty fur draped over her, is one with longer limbs than the others, disproportionaltely so. It gestures, saying something in a language that the group can't understand, and the pale pygmies step foward toward them.
