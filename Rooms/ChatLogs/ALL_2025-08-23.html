<p class="gmtext">In a little house in Boston, a little girl is rummaging through the cupboards, pulling out a tea kettle and some tea bags. Down in the basement, a large hole in the wall (guarded by toy soldiers) reveals a notable tunnel. Down through this tunnel, around a few bends, the tunnels shift from man-made to natural, and open up to large, expansive caves adorned with glowing lichen and strange carvings. And at the end of this tunnel stand four individuals overlooking a large, 40ft deep pit, down which a rope has been dropped as evidence to two other kids who'd snuck down.

<p class="gmtext">This wide cave is the most crafted that you've seen so far. Even though it has natural stalagmites and stalactites, the walls are smoother, worked with rough grooves in which the glowing lichen clings to.&#13;&#13;The cave has clear tunnels; some large enough for you to walk down, and many that are very much a squeeze, if you can fit at all. Another large sinkhole breaks the floor on the far side of the room. Like above, cracks and crevices line the cave's walls, making it uneven.
</p>
<p class="emote">Carl Handy unties the lantern from the bottom of the rope and uses it to look around.
</p>
<p class="ooc">Carl Handy (Carl Handy): can I get any kind of overall picture of the rough grooves from this vantage?  Do they form some kind of pattern or image?

<p class="gmtext">Looking around the room, the group do notice a few things. Carmen notices some faint footprints heading toward the west side, but Carl notices some footprints heading south. It's too hard to tell which, if not both, belong to the kids. The professor is busy looking at the symbols on the walls, while Lillian spots something down the narrow crevice; a pair of quick-release cuffs, wedged against the walls to the east.

About the size of children, their proportions are off; larger torsos, pale skin, and larger hands and feet.

<p class="gmtext">The ceiling&#8217;s apex is about 150 feet above their heads. Spreading across the far wall is a bizarre, twisted structure fashioned from interlaced bronze pipes and studded with crystals of various sizes and colors.

There is a rock formation 20 feet in front of it, carved into a sort of chair, though, its curving seat and back aren&#8217;t comfortable for humans.
