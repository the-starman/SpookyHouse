<p class="gmtext">With Joe having staggered into the church to go recouperate, the group finishes up their conversation with Walter Dodge, leaving him a bit deflated at not having found Cornthwaite. He heads back toward the office, running a hand through thinning hair. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The shadows grow longer as evening approaches, dusk only an hour or two away. Along the street, the Dodge's building seems to be the only one active. The sheriff's office is closed and locked, Sheriff Whitford apparently out and about. Similarly, Sam seems to have closed up the newspaper for the day as well. Even the general store seems to have closed down for the night, having served their expected clients. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">One set of words lingers between the investigators.

<p class="emote">Carl Handy grabs a sack of salt and heads for the front door

<p class="gmtext">The house looms in front of the group. Carmen approaches the front door, carefully taking hold of the handle. She braces herself, her salted companions at the ready
</p>
<p class="gmtext">She flings the door open, and a giant flood of slime and ooze with gibbering mouths and blinking eyes is conspicuously missing. The rooms sit before you much as they had before.

<p class="gmtext">The group heads through the house, trailing salt behind them as they go. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The reverse side of the kitchen, with more lighting and an egresss. It's one of those little kitchens for use in the summer when entertaining guests in the yard. But the room is quite bare and it's clear that Cornthwaite's seen little use for it. It's got just as much staining along its ceiling and walls as the kitchen does.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Checking the door to the south of the kitchen, it does still seem to be stuck

</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house lightly creeks in the wind outside, a gust of wind flowing in from the front. 
</p>
<p class="emote">Carl Handy keeps going
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl rips the handle off, his free hand ready to throw salt through. The wood splinters a bit, and it's a good thing that the salt is thrown immediately. A tendral of ooze is already forming to kill Carl right off the bat, but as the salt hits it there's a shudder through the house. Steam billows off of the fluid surface, and it retreats  back through into the darkness on the other side.

</p>
<p class="gmtext">There is a turkey baster in the upstairs cupboard. Pulling it out and pouring some salt into a can, she turns on the water at the sink to fill it up. Nothing comes out immediately, though the faucet does rattle slightly as she waits.

<p class="gmtext">It is, in fact, not water which emerges eventually. A thick goop pours out, filling the bucket. A mouth forms in the substance, letting out a horrifying scream, like that of a child on fire. The goop hisses and crackles, a billow of smoke pouring out and into Lillian's face for a moment.
