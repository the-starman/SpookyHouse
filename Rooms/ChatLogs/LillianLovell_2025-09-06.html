</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group stands before a large cave. Dominating it is an enormous natural column that has been carved into the likeness of a great, coiled serpent. Upon its forehead, the gems on its forehead glitter in the lamplight, forming a white crescent. A large altar sits before it, marred by dark stains and decorated with intertwined geometric carvings and runes. The golden censers on either side of the altar leak out a soft, perfumed mist as the group steps into the room.

<p class="emote">Carmen Santamonica steps up the stairs to inspect the alter
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The altar is lifted up, with the surface of it being almost 6ft off the ground. Carl can stand next to it and stand on his toes if he wants to look onto the top.

</p>

</p>
<p class="whisper">Lillian Lovell: oh no the full statue like the back of the room
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The altar has seen repeated use, it seems, though none recent. Carmen's investigation shows that it really is just solid stone, no buttons or anything built into it. The surface itself is fairly clean, though the blood splatters along the side aren't fully cleaned up. The professor can identify several layers of blood splatter, suggesting multiple sacrifices. But they're from long ago, decades at least, with some being probably decades older than others. 
</p>
<p class="whisper"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: Indeed you can! Do you wanna stick on the ground? A Spot Hidden or other roll can be used as you investigate it.
</p>

</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking over the statue, the serpent is intricately carved, even along the back. Carl can't even see any signs of work, being so pristinely polished that it's not even collecting dust. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian slides toward the back as well. The statue looks solid from behind, and there's no signs of any sort of secret passage; no hinges or outlines that could be a door frame. Neither on the walls nor on the statue itself.

But if what I saw was even remotely accurate to what the snake is, I don't think we have any chance of fighting or killing it.  I think defference is our only option should it come to it.
