<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Carmen can walk in and explain to Lillian and Plato 
</p>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): yeah probabliy not at this poitn 
</p>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): yeah he doesn't have the axe
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: So, he seems harmless enough. His name is Joe. He's from the local press.
</p>
<p class="player">GM: Just a quick announcement here: I got some feedback from y'all, and I want to adjust how we do our exploration and fact-finding. 
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): WELL, I think we DID decide on that first thing, I don't remember if there was a consensu on the second part
</p>
<p class="player">GM: One common point is that there's a bit of difficulty with order of actions and with more tension. So to address those I want to implement Turns, similar to OD&#38;D
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yeah okay that would make sense!
</p>
<p class="player">GM: One Turn is 30min, and allows you to do a thorough search. You can do a sped up search in 15min if you accept +1P (one penalty die) for your roll. Spending a Turn looking things over suggests a more thorough investigation than just glancing around. 
</p>
<p class="player">GM: This will both ensure that all four players are able to do something (rather than one player getting accidentally steamrolled) and also put a bit of a cost on your searches
</p>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): that makes sense
</p>
<p class="player">GM: You could all spend a Turn searching Cornthwaite's room, but that means we go from 4:00pm to 4:30pm. If you all fail, you can do it again, but then it goes from 4:30pm to 5:00pm
</p>
<p class="player">GM: This should also encourage splitting up, since reasonably you don't need four of you doing a search in one room to expect at least one success
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): ...With how we roll?
</p>
<p class="player">GM: Though if you want to, you absolutely can, it'll just take twice as long
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Either or would be fine with me based on GM feeling for the situation
</p>
<p class="player">GM: If you have two or more people searching a room, you can split the work up to make it go faster. One person checks one half, and the other person checks the other half, and it takes half as long. BUT, if someone misses their roll on the upper half, y'all may miss information that is hidden their (ie the secret fireplace)
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): This is making logical sense and helping to bridge the dice and real world. I like it!
</p>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): I'm not carmen is 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group gathers up on the upper balcony, with a new addition of a Mr Joe Virelli. Carmen catches the Professor and Lillian up as they join in. 
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli: So, you're all looking for books, was it? And Arthur?
</p>
<p class="emote">Joe Virelli positions himself closer to the window so he can breathe
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: The books are the primary reason we're here. Yes. Arthur's disappearance stuck odd so we decided to look around
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli: Hey, I'm all for it
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Y'all know that Joe's been with the Gamwell Gazette for probably 10 years, or at least he's been writing articles for them for that long. You had to go through a lot of his stuff when looking for facts about Cornthwaite
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): And the major events of the house were 30 and 60 years ago
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Professor do you want to interrogate Joe?
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli: How much have you searched?
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: Majority of the house. Only a few rooms left, maybe one on first and one on this floor. Not the basement or the attic. Yet.
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: There's a door on the first floor off the kitchen that we suspect goes to the basement. There's also the door to the right behind me that is locked. 
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli: I remember when Arthur moved in, most of the old furntiure left here was just crammed into the basement rather than bother selling it. Who knows what's down there now?
</p>
<p class="emote">Joe Virelli leans over to check out the door
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: Hopefully not our last missing book.
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli: Could try picking or forcing the lock
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/LillianLovell.png" alt="Lillian Lovell"><strong>Lillian Lovell</strong>: Could always try the attic since were right here anyways 
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): What's locckpicking check for?
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: Yeh but what skill,  sorry?
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yeah mine is a 20
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli: Also, that's quite the accent you've got there, ma'am. Mind if I ask where you're from? I can't quite place it
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/ProfessorPlato.png" alt="Professor Plato"><strong>Professor Plato</strong>: Can I ask what brings you here, Joe? looking for Arthur, but I imagine a reporter isn't here just to return an axe. Is there some lead you're following up on?
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Who's Joe asking?
</p>
<p class="emote">Lillian Lovell Points to herself &#34;me?&#34;
</p>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): she does
</p>
<p class="emote">Joe Virelli nods his head, pointing at Lillian
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/LillianLovell.png" alt="Lillian Lovell"><strong>Lillian Lovell</strong>: My parents and I emigrated from Romania when I was young. Learning English was a bit hard at first
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli: It is a tough language, indeed
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli (to the Professor): Oh, I figured I'd take a look around to see if he'd returned. I was checking the property, I figured he might've tripped and fallen or something, but no sign of any bodies out there. I found the axe sorta tossed by the wayside, though. It'd been out there long enough to get sticky with something, but wasn't rusted or anything
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/LillianLovell.png" alt="Lillian Lovell"><strong>Lillian Lovell</strong>: Sticky?
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli: Yeah, it'd gotten sap or something on it, just kinda gross like
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarlHandy.png" alt="Carl Handy"><strong>Carl Handy</strong>: Joe, you seem to be familiar with Arthur and said you've been here before.  Was the house always this way?
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli: No way. I mean, it's been a few weeks since I came around, but it was fine back then
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Quick check for anyone with a locksmith skill better than 20?
</p>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): I too can provide moral support
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I'll keep that in mind Lanta! I'll probably do that after we're done with are initial conversation with Joe here
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: Did you see Arthur at all after he got back from his expidition?
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yes
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli: Yeah, I did the interview with him when he first got back, wrote the article a few days ago when nobody could find him too
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/ProfessorPlato.png" alt="Professor Plato"><strong>Professor Plato</strong>: Joe, have you talked with Sam since you've been back? He mentioned visiting the property a few days ago.
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli: No, haven't been back yet
</p>
<p class="ooc">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): I think he may have been just referring to general troubles and using &#34;Dont go starting any fires&#34; as a turn of phrase
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarlHandy.png" alt="Carl Handy"><strong>Carl Handy</strong>: Joe, you mentioned being familiar with the Society we represent.  Are you a believer in the paranormal?
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli: I've never seen anything myself, but if there's such a thing as hauntings... well, this would be one of them
</p>
<p class="gmtext">As if to back him up, the building creeks softly
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli: Y'all haven't seen a horse on property, have you? 
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: No horse. 
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/LillianLovell.png" alt="Lillian Lovell"><strong>Lillian Lovell</strong>: We haven't but we have heard about potential horsenappings in the area
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli: Yeah I was hoping to find that or Cornthwaite, ideally alive of course. Put on my hiking boots and everything for it. We wanna grab a seat somewhere and keep chatting, or shall we check out the attic or door?
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/LillianLovell.png" alt="Lillian Lovell"><strong>Lillian Lovell</strong>: I think we plan on checking this door first 
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: Carl, give me a hand and we'll try this door. Unless you think you're better with a lock, Joe?
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli: Nah, I try to make it a point not to break in. That sorta thing gets you shot around these parts
</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli: I'm going to take a seat if that's fine with y'all
</p>
<p class="emote">Joe Virelli wanders into the Servant's room on the left
</p>
<p class="player"><img src="../Assets/Images/CarmenSantamonica.png" alt="Carmen Santamonica"><strong>Carmen Santamonica</strong>: Professor, could you keep an eye on Joe for me?
</p>

</p>
<p class="npc">Joe Virelli (from the other room): Oh what is this?

</p>
<p class="gmtext">It doesn't take too long before Carmen's able to undo the old lock, and Carl slides the door open
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Inside, gathering dust, are loot from tombs the world over: pots, vases, statuettes, carvings, musical instruments, idols, and more. Some seem to leer and snicker at you in the gloom. A couple have already been smashed into unrecognizable fragments. All stare with painted outrage, flat eyes hostile to the men who removed them from their ancestral homes. Sitting on a propped up spot is a leather-bound book; De Occulta Philosophia etched in the front.

</p>

</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking through the artifacts, the Professor can't spot any that were added recently. There's a few spots open, as if room was left open for them, but the dust on them indicate that nothing had ever been placed here. It seems like Cornthwaite didn't put anything in here after his last trip, and maybe hadn't even been in here in months. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl notices that there's a rack for a rifle or shotgun. It's empty at the moment, its gun missing in action. There's also an empty box of cartridges for a shotgun.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen just keeps noticing the different eyes. Even the water damage on the walls and ceiling seem to form faces in the gloom, looking down on the group.
</p>
<p class="ooc">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Star I appreciate your observations!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">(To add to the Professor's roll): While it looks like none of the trophies have been dusted or touched, there are some light signs of other presence. Of particular note, it does look like someone went into the drawyer for the box of bullets, and relatively recently.

<p class="emote">Carmen Santamonica nods to Lillian then turns her attention to the open stairway.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">This open space contains lots of junk, from each of the families who have lived here. There are old chests, a rocking horse, a broken mirror, a locked wardrobe, a tailor&#8217;s dummy, odd bits of furniture, and so on. The only significant water damage appears to be along the floors, rather than the ceiling.

<p class="gmtext">The group splits up a bit, covering more ground through the the small paths. The furniture is a mix of eras, some being old fashioned stuff from the 1800s and others being more recent. It appears mostly the stuff on the west side is more old, and the stuff on the east side is more new. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The light that filters in from the vents is barely enough to see, but the intrepid investigators has some flashlights. It seems like a lot of the furniture and boxes have an almost shiny sheen to them, an irridescent reflection. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Interestingly, as the group makes it toward the north end of the attic space, one trunk has been absolutely flattened outwards. Burst as if an explosion had taken place in its interior. The inside are the remains of jungle clothing; a pith helmet, a compass, a .45 revolver, and a machete. This stuff in particular is very shiny, though dry to the touch.

<p class="gmtext">Picking up the compass, Carmen holds it level. Rather than pointing north, it seems to slowly spin around as if undecided.

<p class="gmtext">looking over the scene, the Professor notices several details. The area close to the suitcase has a more noticeable sheen, but the area outside of it isn't consistent. It's almost a... splash of it, striking out along the ground and hitting the wall and the boxes and couch that are nearby. It's as if it built up pressure from within with some sort of fluid from within, then burst free. Picking up a set of pants, it looks like it may have come from those. The pocket is torn apart.

<p class="gmtext">Enormous and bloated, a swell of green substance rises from the floor.
