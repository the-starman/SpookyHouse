<p class="gmtext">Saturday morning is a relaxed and calm day for most, but not for all. This morning, three individuals sit at a table for four, waiting for their host to arrive. Each has received a letter, a commission, to look into the affairs of a Mr Steven Knott
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">(If you hit the Notes tab of your character sheet, there's a small blurb for your character. Feel free to modify it as you like)
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Breakfast arrives to the three individuals at the table just as another man walks in. He's small and in his 50s with heavy eyebrows. The cane he's brought thunks on the ground as he makes his way over, leaning on it rather heavily. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">takes a seat at the table in the remaining chair.
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">If you three have questions, you can ask Mr Knott now as he eats breakfast. 
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">But yeah, talk to each other with plans. Where do you want to go? What do you want to know? I can provide guidance of where you might go to find stuff
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Nope you can just ask
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">It seems that Knott is under the impression it could just be anything, but you can check out what happened to his sister-in-law for more details. Either the old news papers in the Library or going directly to the source at the Sanitarium. 
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">*to his cousin, pardon me

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">If you want to Help someone with a roll, they can gain a Bonus Die by hitting the +1B button before rolling
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Our intrepid investigators bid farewell to Mr Knott and head over toward the Boston Library. Fortunately, these Librarians are not the ones from Nightvale, and are able to point our heroes over toward the Newspaper Archives. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Flawless

<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Carmen can hit the +B button and roll as well, since she's having a librarian help her look through as well. 
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Roll for it, Professor!

</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Pretty much. A &#34;turn&#34; for research is 6 hours, so instead of rolling your own die you helped boost the Professor's
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Correct, Illy. The staff is going to help you look into stuff, so you get a +1B too
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">You can, but if you do research for 3 hours you'll get a Penalty die, the opposite of a Bonus die
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Rushing it can be done, though
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Mhm
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">While researching, the professor stumbles across the first article mentioning the house. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">A second article is discovered not too long later by Carl
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">(the headlines are legit headlines from the 20s)
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Yes. If you take the little icon in the top left, you can click and drag them into the bar in the bottom of your UI

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen discovers some news as well, of a different sort
</p>
<p class="gmtext">And the final piece which the group discovers is found with the help of one of the librarians. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">1925
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Alas, the article does not specify what those habits are, though clearly they were displeasing to the neighbors. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">That was me
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">No those are the same kids that Knott told you about
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Our amazing investigators make their way over to the Hall of Records. It's around 4:30pm by the time they arrive, giving them ample opportunity to do some research with their remaining daylight hours
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">(Note that while rushing to get this done in 3 hours instead of 6 does give a penalty die, you also get a bonus die for having someone help you. Those would cancel each other out)
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Did it go away?
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">And I gave it back :D
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Still Library Use to check out the Hall of Records
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">You can just not do either, and just roll like normal
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The secretary to the Hall of Records greets the Professor and Mr Handy, letting them into the archive. The pair work together, sifting through wills until they discover one of particular interest. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Meanwhile, over on Sheafe Street, Carmen arrives at her destination. The little house is overshadowed by taller, newer office buildings on either side. The house fronts the street, with a small porch. On either side, withered plants lead down narrow alleyways to its back yard. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Out front, there's a single man with a small cigar and newspaper stand who gives a wave. The other buildings seem to be closed for the weekend; a small law firm, a dentist's office, a small bookstore. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Overall, I assume you're copying down the details from the articles you have
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">This is like Carl holding the paper up to the light to try and see what is blocked out
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">That's fine by me
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">You can go for one of your Interpersonal rolls here if you'd like, or you can just pay him some from your $25. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You realize that you could push the roll if you want, pointing out the condition of Mr Dooley's shabby cart. Obviously an improvement of the neighborhood would benefit him. Of course, he might take that the wrong way...
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It appears that he's been offended and isn't really willing to give more about the supposed haunting, but you know that someone gave him that idea. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house looms in front of Carmen. Perhaps, if someone can't answer the question for her...
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The street appears to be largely businesses now, none open by this point in the evening on a Saturday. Carmen has some time left if she has other leads to follow up on, or she can meet up with her friends. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Circling around the house, it leads to a small, dead back yard with a small dead tree. The windows are dirty and dark, not letting much light nor vision through them at all. A few supplies sit in the back yard, like lumber and a box of nails
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Hall of Records is open until 9pm
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking into the Church shouldn't be too tough. With help from Carl and the name, you can make the roll rushed with a bonus die
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">You get +1P for rushing, +1B for Carl (canceling out), and +1B for having the name and an easier search. 
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">So you have +1B overall
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Two things of note come up in the search. One is the address, allowing you three to go check out the premisis. However, more importantly...
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The Hall of Records does close down, which leaves the pair free to go meet up with Carmen, check out the church, or check out the house. But before that, we must follow Carmen's track
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Heading out toward the outskirts, Carmen catches a lift to the Sanitarium. The building is large and sturdy, but it's got plenty of flowers and greenery. The receptionist looks up at her as she enters. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">A few minutes later, he leads Carmen back through the wards. It's a pretty peaceful scene, and they wind up near a window overlooking the gardens out back. Sitting in a little chair is Gabriela Macario a bible on her hands. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Mr Knott: Oh I have no idea on the age, it's pretty old though. Oldest on the street, I think. Four rooms on the first floor, four on the second, plus the bathroom. Small basement.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Mr Knott: Oh I have no idea on the age, it's pretty old though. Oldest on the street, I think. Four rooms on the first floor, four on the second, plus the bathroom. Small basement.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It's worth noting that the house's yard is almost entirely in shadow now due to the buildings on either side.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Stepping out of the sanitarium, Carmen has something to think about as she heads back toward Boston to meet up with her partners. The three of them gather for a late dinner to discuss their plans
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There's a few places for them to go, but the most obvious ones are to check out the house itself or to check out the old Chapel. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Where do you want to go from here?
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Are you going at night then?
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Or sleeping first?
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">It's a little difficult to navigate in the darkness, but it doesn't take too long. Only a few blocks from the house, they find what's left of the church. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The ruins are so weathered and overgrown with greenery that the stone rubble seems more like natural stone than former walls and foundation. You pass a slumping wall bearing white-painted grafiti which looks concerningly like an eye. It's hard to feel like you're not being watched as you pick your way through. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Yup
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">One bonus die total. Exactly!
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Hit the +B, then double click STR
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">With the three of you pushing on it, the wall begins to creak. Slowly, you feel something give, and the barrier collapses with a loud crash. Looking at it in the moonlight, the symbol is smashed to pieces along with the wall. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The empty yard waits for you in the moonlight. You can see what used to be the chapel doors ahead of you, long since burnt to cinders
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Each of you roll a Spot Hidden as you make your way in. Who has flashlights out?
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Also you can absolutely roll with your Art Skill
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Yup
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Carl has an eye for art, but unfortunately only an eye for art. He's so focused on the piece of rubble that he's largely blind to anything else
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Carl, can you roll your ARt skill for me? 
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Carmen, can you roll your Spot Hidden for me?
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Carl notices that the lines and eye shape are drawn with an unexpected level of precision. Usually graffiti is pretty haphazard, or applies its messiness in artistic expression. But this involved a lot of care with how the lines and oval were drawn while not really expressing much. Just a plain series of white lines. Even the pupil, from what he can see in the rubble, is a near-perfect circle.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen leads the way into the building with the professor at her back. It's fortunate she lead the way, too, since she's the one who notices that it's not just blocks of granite and half-burnt timbers. The floor they're standing on isn't just wood-on-earth anymore, and the wood creaks dangerously.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There's a basement here.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl realizes, a bit belatedly, that he's the only one still outside
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Go ahead and make a Luck roll for me
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The shiver at being alone in the moonlight is enough to put a bit of pep in Carl's step as he heads in. Fortunately, the heavy thump of his boots don't dislodge the floorboards more than they already are. As the group peers around to the left, they find that there's a large hole between some of the old pews. Across the room from them to the right, a door sits nestled into the wall, swung open and displaying the staircase. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">You could creep over toward the door to take a peek, you can't tell how safe it is from here. 
</p></div></div>

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Jumping back, a portion of the floor collapses to form a second hole.

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Sneaking out around, the trio make it to the wall. There's some rubble, but it still will take some effort to climb. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You can get a bonus die if there's someone available to give you a boost, but whoever goes last is going to have to roll plain Climb

<p class="gmtext">Carl does spot a portion of the wall, not one that can be knocked down, but one where a piece of rebar could be wedged in to give an easier climbing route. With the brickwork damaged as it is, there's plenty of handholds for the three to make it up past the toughest part. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The rebar is easy to find and implement. It takes a lot less time than expected to get everything in place.

<p class="gmtext">Leading the way, the group wanders down to the basement space. It looks like a bit of a storage space, but you can see where the boards collapsed earlier. A false wall, cracked apart and exposing a part of the basement separate from the rest of the basement.

<p class="gmtext">The professor spends a fair bit of time sorting through the main area of the basement, but does not find much of anything
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen and Carl, though, find some interesting things. An altar sits on the far side, with a cabinet and two skeletons that are dressed in tattered silk robes. Perhaps they were hiding here during the fire? 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The cabinet contains a series of old papers, most of which crumble to the touch. But one piece, viewed by flashlight, lets Carmen catch a few words before it crumbles: &#34;Corbitt&#34;, &#34;basement&#34;, &#34;in accordance with his wishes&#34;and &#34;the one who waits in the dark&#34;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl, leaning on the altar, notices that it has a small cubby on the front. Leaning down, he pulls out a small, leatherbound tomb.
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Carl, can you add &#34;Liber Ivonis&#34; to your character sheet?

<p class="gmtext">The bodies have no notable wounds to them, though they are gross to the touch. It's reasonable to assume that they died of suffocation or the like, given the soot and grime both above and below them. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">They're both above a layer and below a layer, suggesting they were moving around as the fire burned
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Probably about a decade or so, but it's really hard to tell. Definitely not 100s of years. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">That appears to be most of it. While checking out the bodies, Carmen and Carl continue to filter around, but there don't appear to be much else down here. No secret tunnels, at least.

</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house itself is pretty close, so the group heads over toward it. It's almost midnight by the time they arrive, the moon high in the sky

<p class="gmtext">The front door opens to a small foyer. To the left hang long abandoned overcoats, galoshes, hats and umbrellas. Several bags of coal sit to the right.&#13;&#13;There's an open doorway to the right leading into the parlour. A stairwell leads directly in front of you, leading to a landing which leads both to another room on the other side and to the second floor. The northwest corner of the room is cut off, and a door sits diagonal to the walls there.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Flicking the switch, the lights do not turn on. Circuit breaker must have tripped at some point.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You can see the parlour from here, the fireplace sitting on the far side of the room. The building is deathly quiet as your flashlights sweep across dozens and dozens of crosses, all stuck to the walls firmly.

<p class="gmtext">Listening closely, the house is silent. The crackle from the fire in the other room is barely audible. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">A conventional kitchen, with icebox, wood-fed stove and oven, plus a meager larder. Some of the foodstuffs may be edible; there is canned soup and meat, rice kernels, several pastas and a few bottles of homemade wine. The rest of the produce is either spoiled or consumed by rats, which appear to have had quite the feast.&#13;&#13; An exterior door sits on the north side of the room, with three deadbolts and a chain locking it shut. On the west side of the south wall is a little set of stairs leading to a landing, and beyond that another room. On the east side of the south wall is a closed interior door.

<p class="gmtext">Carmen, you think you saw something over on the shelves. You'll need to move closer to get a better look.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Getting back up to it, you move a can to the side and jump back as a rat scurries out. It leaps down to the floor, scampering under the table and into a hole in the cabinet on the east side of the wall

<p class="gmtext">Glancing up at the assortment of things in the reception room, the professor notes that there are a few sets of kids coats and adults. They're old, and covered in dust.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The room he's in is similarly dusty, though the bags of coal were not. A mix of things that've been restocked, probably by Knott, and things that were left by the house's last occupants.

<p class="gmtext">This is the dining room, complete with a long mahogany table, a built-in sideboard and seven chairs. Three places are set and unused. Scraps of rice soup rot in a tureen.&#13;&#13;There's a fireplace in the southeast corner of the room, with the room's only door to the southwest.

<p class="gmtext">Two beds sit in this room, along with a large wardrobe. Again, another closet, and a number of dolls that someone had pointed at the door for some reason. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">A bathroom containing a sink, bathtub and a water closet with an overhead tank. Towels and other possessions are still here, typical to a family of four. A brackish pool of water has collected in the bathtub. A single bubble rises to the surface of the opaque water.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">This room contains a bed frame, bare bedsprings and a dresser. Though unused, this room looks like the other bedrooms.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">An ordinary bedroom, with a double bed, bookshelf and window view. Apparently the room of Vittorio and Gabriela. The room is positively covered in crosses, with several bibles sitting along the book shelves. Beads from a rosary, long since broken, lie scattered across the floor.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">In none of the rooms do the group find signs of anyone... except...

<p class="gmtext">With that, the lights shut off once more. And they do not turn back on

<h3>Session Date: 2025-03-08</h3>
<p class="gmtext">As Carl, Carmen, and the Professor discuss their plans on the upstairs landing, something thumps from downstairs. They all hear it, and the lights flicker alongside a second thump. Then, a third. And there, standing in between the three of them for just a moment as the light flickers, is a man. Just as soon as he is there, he's gone, and so are the lights.

<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carl Handy
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Sitting on top of the professor is Carmen, who's got the man pinned below her. As the light shines over, both of them realize that the professor's wrists, while pinned behind his back, are holding a flashlight in one hand and a rusty knife in the other. He thrashes beneath Carmen, yelling in what might be Latin
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl tries to grab the knife out of his wrist, but he bucks and twists. The blade knicks the handyman, causing him to pull back
</p>

<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato [Latin]: get off me demon!!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Professor Plato
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Flailing about, the professor does little to change his circumstances. With nowhere to go, he seems to run out of energy after 10 seconds or so, breathing heavily on the ground as he comes back to his senses
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato [English]: what happened? and where did i get this knife?! also this floor is dirty, i would like to get up
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The knife itself is in poor condition, but the handle is strangely ornate. It's a near-black laquered wooden handle, carved with intricate geometric patterns.
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">You may push that if you want.

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato [English]: i don't know what's going on. the lights flickered and next thing i was on the ground
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato [English]: i think i recall seeing that knife in the kitchen though
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato [English]: there seems to be old blood on this knife. maybe it was used in a ritual?
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Downstairs, you can hear a door slowly creak

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato [English]: time to GTFO. that's latin for leaving quickly
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The trio head down the stairs, slowly making their way into the darkness. A rat scurries through the reception room and into the parlour
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Peeking around the corner, the door into the little hallway is open. But you can't see past the deep darkness in there
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The door to the kitchen, too, is open. But you can't see through it to the hallway, not without shining your flashlight over there. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The trio runs out the door, pushing past it and slamming it shut behind them. Carmen pauses for only a moment to lock the door, which takes far too long for comfort, but she's finally able to pull away and rush back out. The three of them stand on the street, looking at the little house, the light from the fire in the fireplace shining out through the dirty parlour window. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">The figure was a haunting one.

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Opening up the front door door, Carmen slips back into the house. Turning the corner from the reception, the flashlight shines across the parlour. Several rats leap off of the little side table, scurrying under other furniture. Sitting on the table is the book.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">And out she goes, leaving the dark house behind her with the book in tow
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato [English]: Let's do that. we can continue to look around here in the morning when it's hopefully less spooky
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The trio make it back to Carl's place. He lets them into the apartment, which is tidy but disorganized. Nicknacks cover the shelves, alongside tools and spare parts like nails and twine. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl does not have a safe, but he does have an open spot in his knife rack in the kitchen
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Morning comes all too soon, or perhaps not soon enough. None of the trio gets a good night's sleep, but you're awaken in daylight at the end of it all.

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The figure was a man's, hairless with tattered clothes. It had no lips, its teeth exposed, and its eyes. Its eyes were terrible, dark saucers reflecting a light that wasn't there.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato [English]: wish i hadn't seen it, but it sounds the same
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato [English]: yes, the knife was stabbed into the kitchen table. i do not recall grabbing the knife before investigating the sounds that lead into the basement
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">It's worth mentioning that neither Carmen nor Carl recognize this knife from their trip through the kitchen and dining room. 
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato [English]: the first sounds were from Carl yelling into the whole. then there were sounds of footsteps that lead to the basement. which is when i went upstairs
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato [English]: i went from the parlour to the dining room (Carl yelling), towards the basement stairs, then upstairs through the kitchen without stopping in the kitchen
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There's a small used bookshop that Carmen knows about, Speaks Volumes. They also carry little nicknacks and serve as a pawnshop to older things. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato doesn't have any historical insights on the dagger. It doesn't appear to be ancient egyptian, at least. It's a more recent dagger than that at least. 
</p>

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">At the bookshop, Carmen speaks with Malachi Hodges, owner of Speaks Volumes. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato [English]: no one that would be available today
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Malachi is honest and straight forward, though he does run a pawn shop kind of, so that can rub people the wrong way sometimes
</p>

<p class="gmtext">Miskatonic University is a university a bit to the north of Boston. It's known for its history and archeolgogy department. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The book is a translation by Caius Phillipus Faber of another book. Many of the pages are rotten through, but the parts you can make out contain accounts of a powerful wizard, Eibon, as he adventures in the Vale of Pnath and Shaggai. It has whole excerpts which pause the story to provide detail about the spells and rituals he performed, knowledge granted to him by both elder gods and beings that the book refers to only as &#34;Old Ones&#34;.

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Carl recognizes that the repeating patterns are pretty similar between some of the diagrams in the book and the knife. It's a lot of swirling shapes, spirals with other curves tucked into them. It's not a direct match, but perhaps the knife was inspired by some of this?
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">So for sequence of events, what did you mean? 
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The thing seemed to just appear in the group, and freaked everyone out. It did not do anything particular toward the Professor (didn't talk, didn't gesture, etc)
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It is quite possible it was just a panic attack
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The knife is still weirdly grimey for being wrapped in a towel. That gunk is really stuck on the blade.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl uses the paint thinner and rags to clean the dagger off, and it cleans off probably 90% of the gunk on it. The blade itself does have similar etchings to the handle. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There is a window to the back yard which is at ground level, and some dim light does reach it despite the dead tree in the yard and the buildings surounding the yard. It looks like it can lever open, but not from the outside. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">None of the buildings that surround this property have windows on this side, so it's just solid bricks on all sides. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">No witnesses \o/
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The window shatters, and nothing grabs Carl to drag him inside.
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Y'all are in the back yard still
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The back yard does have a tree, as well as a pile of lumber and a few other building supplies under a tarp
</p>

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Looking around the yard, Carmen think that you can get a better feel by heading over and sifting through the supplies. It's possible that things wind up damaged if you're not careful, though (ie if you fail the pushed roll)
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Heading over toward the pile of lumber, Carmen lifts up the edge and peels away the tarp. It's only then that she realizes it's absolutely full of rats, which swarm out onto her
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[ROUND 1]
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carmen Santamonica
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Now that it's mentioned, the rats swarm toward the group almost as one. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Potential destinations include: toward Carl and the Professor by the basement window, through the basement window (open), through the first floor kitchen or dining room windows (closed), through the back door (closed), into/around the tree, or through the alley on either side of the house toward the road

</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carmen Santamonica
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Rat Pack
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The rats swarm through the group. Carmen dodges out of the way, but both the professor and Carl fail to move anywhere except in the way of the rats. Every step Carl takes seems to land on a rat, though their teeth seem incapable of biting his ankles through his boots. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Not so for the professor, who finds one rat scampering up his pants leg to a concerning distance before he cuts it off and kicks it out, only a little worse for wear
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carl Handy
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The basement looks like a mess. It's cramped, but you can see a bench, a lot of strewn tools, pipes, some old lumber, and the staircase upstairs.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">And rats, a lot of rats
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Professor Plato
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The rest of the rats swarm through the window as the professor snatches one into his hands. It squeaks and squirms, but he has a firm grip on the lean little squeaker's body
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">You can push it, but if you fail then it'll bite you
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The rat continues to squirm and squeak, trying to free itself from the grip of its oppresser
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The professor examines the rat closely, but realizes that he can't even tell whether it's a boy rat or girl rat
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Other than that weirdly coordinated swarm, it seems normal
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Holding onto the end of the twine, the rat is dropped to the ground and scampers down into the basement with the others
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The spool unwinds
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[ROUND 2]
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Professor Plato
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group is left standing alone in the back yard, a quiet settling upon them as the chittering dies away
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking through the pile, it just looks like a pile of lumber. Of note, there's no obvious signs of rat droppings or things like that. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group pins the string roll under some of the logs, making sure it can't unwind more and leaving the rat at the end of its rope (literally)
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Done
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group works their way around to the front door, unlocking it and entering the reception space. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house is quiet, just as chill as the air outside. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Pulling out food, it's easy to set it up with the rat poison mixed in. Also of note is the circuit breaker, which it appears was tripped at some point or another. Flipping it restores power to the house's lights, which come back on. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The electrical system is simple enough that Carl can jury rig the system so the the circuits don't flip, either mechanically or electrically. This can be done on a room-by-room basis. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You hear a loud thump from upstairs
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It sounds like something large just hit the ground pretty forcefully
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Leaning over toward the staircase, it sounded like it came from above the parlour
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Leaning over toward the staircase, it sounded like it came from above the parlour
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The size was heavy, probably one or two hundred pounds of thump
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Phonetically, it was a loud &#34;THUMP&#34;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">In fact, it really did sound like a body
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group spreads the poisoned canned food around the kitchen, dining room, and down through the basement window
</p>
<p class="gmtext">From their, they travel to the second story to investigate the sound
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Getting upstairs, all the doors are open except for one. The guest bedroom's door is closed. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The handle turns without a problem
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The door creaks open. The room is almost entirely bare, except for a bed frame against the northern wall.
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Spot Hidden checks
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The three of you notice something on the south window. The dirt and grime on it stop you from seeing any details through it, but it looks as if something is writing on the window. Slowly, in small letters that you can't make out from back here. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">SAN checks
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">There's nothing there, but it looks like something's writing it on there. Like with a finger, wiping off the dust and dirt
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen slowly moves toward the window to get a better read on it. She pauses for a moment as the Professor throws salt in. The salt hits the window, but doesn't interrupt the letters as they form on it
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen steps up to the window, where the writing spells out two words
</p>
<p class="gmtext">L E A V E  N O W 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The poison on the first floor appears untouched
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Peeking in through the basement window, the Professor doesn't see any of the food touched down there, either. But it's kinda hard to tell from outside, you did throw it down there pretty haphazardly. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">None of you see any rats at all
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You do still see the string leading down to the basement
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Pulling on the string, it does pull closer. There's some resistance, as if something is pulling against it, but it's pretty faint. You think that the string's probably stuck on a lot of things. You could try reeling it in further
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl can see the string vanish into the debris in the basement. There's just piles of stuff all over, some covered in tarps and some boxed up
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl flips the light switch on for the basement and heads downstairs with the rest of the group. The staircase is in bad condition, though, and footing seems as precarious as the partially attached railing. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl is unsure of his footing. He could try to push the roll, but if he fails he's likely to lose his footing and take a tumble.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl pulls the dining room table to the door, scraping along the hardwood. He ties more of his rope to the leg, and uses that to help himself  down the stairs. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">With the extra support, he makes his way down the stairwell. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The basement is small, the window providing way better light than the dim light bulb in the ceiling. Three walls are made of stone, with the last being wooden planks with hooks and rods on it to hang up tools which are long since missing. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It's full of garbage, the east half of the room being buried in boxes, tables, and other smaller things crammed in there
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl heads out to grab some lanterns from his car, a pry bar, shovels, sledgehammer, a molotov, and paint thinner. As he makes it to the car, he sees the bed frame on the street, a chunk missing from the pavement where it hit the street maybe 6 inches in front of his car. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Passing down some tree branches and a pan, the group set up a big pan with wood inside. Using newspapers from the basement, they set a fire down there, then the Professor and Carmen climb back out. Slowly, the smoke begins to fill the basement. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Smoke begins to filter out through the basement window, forming a small black column up toward the evening sky. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl can see the commotion inside as he begins nailing the boards into place. The rats begin to pour out of the junk pile. He can push the roll, but if he fails he won't be able to secure the last board in time before the rats begin spilling out onto him.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl has no problem getting the board in place. The last thing he sees, though, is a bit concerning. The rats gathering up around the burning pan. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The smoke is drastically reduced as the window is borded up. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Something tries to open the door, but fails. You can feel the door get tugged several times, the handle turning as if someone stronger than either of you alone could resist. But you're not alone. And you hold, for several seconds, before it stops. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It is around this time that the skittering horde of rates, with a burning can held amongst them, rounds the corner of the building. They move with a purpose towards the trio.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen points her pistol at the can, her aim true. She pulls the trigger and it clicks; a dud round, the bullet simply not going off. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The rats physically heave the can, moving like a wave. The rats in the wake of it collapse, fur smouldering as their comrades run over. The can hurtles in the air, embers and burning bits of newspaper flying free as it's hurled at the Professor. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato stands his ground, kicking the can with force as it approaches. His foot hits the bottom, and the can is sent hurtling back at the rats. It strikes their center, exploding and spilling burning pieces throughout the swarm. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The fire smokes about half the swarm, the other half of which scatters. The pan, slightly glowing, and a variety of burning pieces are taken up by the rat swarm like a tiny little angry mob

</p>
<p class="gmtext">The rats charge forth with their tiny torches, the mass of them moving toward Carl. He swings with the massive board, hitting a few, but it's large and unweildy enough that many are able to bypass and stab into him with burning debris. His boots smoulder as they scamper up and stab him into the thighs as well.

<p class="gmtext">Fortunately, the rats aim is just as bad as before as Carmen dances away, the board doing more to steady herself than swing at them. No blows are landed this time.

</p>
<p class="gmtext">With one great swing, Carl sweeps low. His board hits most of the rats, and between their tiny torches and the side of the house, they're smashed together into a jumble. They hiss and squeak, fur burning and smoking, flailing about useless. The last few rats turn and scatter, fleeing from the group.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The swarm is dead
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Now, the way to the basement is unimpeded

</p>
<p class="gmtext">Heading down to the aired out basement, the evening light doesn't illuminate it quite as well. But with no rats, there doesn't seem to be any motion or commotion going on
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Clearing out the garbage in the wall, the group accesses the wooden boards. With the crowbar, it's easy to peel them away. Doing so reveals a small 5ft wide area of the room, with a stone wall and a door leading to a second room. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lying motionless and seemingly dead on a pallet in the centre of the room is a drawn, woodenlooking, wizened figure of some six-feet, skinny and naked, with ghastly wide-flaring, saucerlike eyes and a nose like a knife blade. The figure looks eerily similar to the one you saw for that brief moment upstairs. &#13;&#13;Some sort of chain rests around his neck. He has lost all hair and his shrunken gums make his teeth look very long. From him comes a sharp, sweet, churning scent, like rotten corn. The floor is earthen and there is a table in the southwest corner with some curled papers on it, a small haphazard bookshelf underneath it.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The whole room remains comfortably still, but Carl perhaps is uncomfortably so. He doesn't move to go bring stuff out to the truck. Instead, his eyes roll up into his head and he draws the crowbar from his belt.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">As Carmen goes to drop the lighter onto the dry husk of the body, it's arm lurches up to grab her wrist. She drops the lighter sooner than intended, but it still lands on the corpse. It turns its saucer-like eyes toward her, lips parting as the flames begin to catch

<p class="gmtext">Carl's eyes start to roll back down, his vision swimming as he hears words that aren't through his ears. &#34;KILL KILL KILL&#34;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl strikes a blow with the crowbar, and it seems to dig into the skin. The skin cracks, smoulders bursting free as the being begins to howl at the group. Seemingly not needing air, the keening picks up and continues relentlessly
</p>

</p>
<p class="gmtext">The bullet grazes its head, taking a chip off of its skull. Still, it continues
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The creature's head crumples, and the whole body goes out. A gloom seems to immediately lift from the room, something none of you even noticed was there. The body hits the ground, turning to ash even faster than the fire can reach it. Soon, all that is left is a smouldering impression in the dirt, a chain and medalion sitting atop it.

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The group is left in silence, breathing heavy. Everyone's hearts are racing. Carl's eyes hurt from having been rolled up into his head for too long. The main basement's junk pile has a little path carved through it from where things had been moved out of the way. A hole has been torn into the wooden wall separating the main basement from this small, secret alcove. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">On the floor, a smear of ash is all that remains from the withered body that was once Walter Corbitt. Atop and within it sit the chain and medalion. A table, almost more of an altar, sits in the center of the room. On the far side of the room is a small bookshelf, full of loose-leaf paper, a couple vials, and a few other objects.

</p>
<p class="gmtext">The medallion is a brass coin with a chain strung through it. The recesses appear to have a reddish tint in the light.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">On the front side, a mother seats to the right on a stone, holding a child in the right arm, before it is another child leaned on it and holds the hand begging to the mother. Across the top is written &#34;O GIEB MIR BROD MICH HUNGERT&#34;. Along the bottom is &#34;IETTON&#34;, at the foot of the stone, &#34;Stettner&#34;.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">On the reverse side, the cloud hangs a balance. A scale measures a bag on the left, labeled 1 &#38; 3L below it. On the right is  stone, 12.KR below it. Between the bowls is IMAAS BIER 8&#189; KR. On the state line is an anchor and a sheaf grain, left and right, grain clusters. Caption: VERZAGET NICHT - GOTT OR LEBET NOCH. Along the bottom is 1816.U 1817, and an L below those.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The text does appear to be German.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The bookshelf is covered in loose leaf papers, many of which are strung together with twine or have nails stabbed through the corners and bent into a loop to hold them together. They all appear hand written in the same writing. There's also an ink pen, some very old pencils, and a black box.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The &#34;altar&#34; is a large, heavy wooden table. It doesn't have legs, instead it just has a big block of wood about 2-3ft high, with the surface being expanded larger by about 6in on each side. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">With the report submitted, Mr Knott is pretty pleased with things. He's angry with news of the damage to the bed and window, but seems happier to hear that the square footage is larger than anticipated, so it balances out. He pays you your extra $25 in bonus fees for getting it done before Tuesday. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Having seen the horrible withered corpse of Walter Corbitt turn to dust, the group feels better about going to bed tonight. Everyone gains +1d6 SAN
</p>
<p class="gmtext">In your down time, you have a few options for how you spend your time. Most of it is spent with professional matters, maintaining your Credit Rating. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Option 1: You can spend your downtime researching, allowing you to spend time reading and looking up adjacent tomes or translations for a book you've found. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Option 2: You can spend your time recovering your sanity. This typically involves spending time with the key parts to your backstory under Personal, though it can also involve seeing a professional or being institutionalized for a time. 
</p>

<p class="gmtext">Option 4: You can work to improve a skill of your choice, rolling to improve that skill. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Option 5: You can take on a major project. This is one that would require months of work, such as building a secret room into your house or buying and setting up a new office. This requires a roll for Credit Rating, relating the financial investment required.

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The box itself is plain on the outside, but inscriptions are present on the inside. Carmen has to travel up to New York to talk to an expert in Greek history. Ida Steele meets with her, and gives her a rough translation of the text: &#34;From Tartarus to Elysium, from the Earth to the Heavens, may your Hermes protect you on your journey&#34; 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">(More to come when Illy's back)
</p></div></div>

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The little black stone is odd. When rotating it, it seems to change shape subtly, which you only notice when you were holding it and turned to do something and felt it shift in your hand. It's always uncomfortably cold, as if it had been in a refrigerator. Did you want to take it to any particular experts?
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen seeks out some geologists at Miskatonic University. Professor Julian Gallagher checks it out, but is quite puzzled by it. He can't identify the type of stone it is, though he is pretty sure it's crystalline rather than being a stone. It seems to have a hollow space within it, though it's empty given the sensation when shaken. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Antique experts are also pretty baffled by it. It's not something any of them have heard of before, not even with context of the box, though they do offer to buy it off of Carmen. Known mediums are even worse, the &#34;spiritualists&#34; keep saying it has something to do with Carmen's mother, or her future lover, or her dog (some are worse than the others). 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The professor has no problem getting started on his reading with the book. He's able to give it a proper read this time, though, and this is a bit more unnerving. Roll SAN. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The professor makes it through about half of the notes in the book. It tells the story of the wizard Eibon and his strange travels, and he has to constantly reference different lores from the Greeks, the Egyptians, the Sumerians, and the people of Ur. (He gains 5 more Cthulhu Mythos)
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The copy is hand written and incomplete, leaving most of the wizard's methods and stories incomplete. But one in particular is complete, and that's one where he calls upon the Opener of Ways. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The copy is hand written and incomplete, leaving most of the wizard's methods and stories incomplete. But one in particular is complete, and that's one where he calls upon the Opener of Ways. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">This is a ritual which requires a circle to be etched in the ground and filled with water, and it gives an image of the diagram to sketch. It requires a &#34;pure blade of iron or copper, not of brass&#34;. The ritual itself, judging from how many times you have to repeat the incantation, probably requires an hour and a half at least to cast properly, though Eibon does it in half that time (and is said to be amazing for it). 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">In the story, the Opener of Ways appears and carries Eibon to the dreams of another where he may converse with the man, and then carries him back. Other worlds pass before his eyes, though, and the thought sends shivers up the professor's spione. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Professor Plato gains the spell &#34;Call the Opener of Ways&#34;. This spell will cost Magic Points to cast (you can see them near your hit points). If you don't have enough magic points, then it will draw from your Hit Points after your MP is expended. Casting such a spell will also take a toll on your Sanity (no roll to avoid). 
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">When asking about with the professors, none of the main staff seem familiar with this topic (though you could work to recruit one). Eventually, you stumble across Professor Henry Armitage, the head librarian. The man seems positively spooked when it's brought up, and practically pleads with Professor Plato to end his investigations. &#34;Nothing good can come of this, it's better locked away in the restricted section.&#34;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">When dealing with the Opener of Ways, it does say that &#34;... with his forceful will, he directed the Opener of Ways to carry him&#34;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl sets up his plan to expand his business. Without the proper funds to finance it, he does the most reasonable alternative to taking out a loan: orphans. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">They're not a proper lot, but Carl's able to draw in the interest of several of the homeless and foster kids, teens and young adults. He lays the law down HARD, though, kicking out the troublemakers and getting the rules across with an even hand. The numbers naturally dwindle over time, always cycling in and out as they find the work not to their taste or as they find employment elsewhere. But even after four months, he's still got three regulars coming to him in addition to occasional new-comers.

<p class="gmtext">Carmen pours over the notes of Walter Corbitt.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">He mentions his house many times, which he refers to by the Anglo-French &#34;desmesne&#34; most of the time. Throughout, the notes mention times when he had to provide favors owed from when he claimed the house, and details (quite bitterly) what resources were spent. They're phrased in terms of either time spent, power granted for some purpose, or in gibberish-like names. They're always granted to abbreviations, not to full names. Example: &#34;broke another shell of the Opener in exchange for A.W.'s aid. One left.&#34; followed by scratchings of &#34;hate him&#34; or &#34;Sent the shambler to M.T., debt paid&#34;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">He talks about his &#34;immortality&#34;. Not how he achieved it, but of its tragedy. He rambles about the neighborhood no longer providing enough &#34;fortune&#34; to feed his spells and curses &#34;Thomas&#34; for it. He seems to be overtaken by madness, many of the notes being incoherent scratches or scribbles for periods of time.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">He talks about his athame, the ritual dagger. He talks about sporadic sacrifices; cats, rats, and attempted human sacrifices to lift himself from his fugue. Even with his athame supposedly &#34;streamlining the transfer of blood to power&#34;, it's never enough.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">And throughout, he talks more and more about the rats. He workshops a way to use a medallion he procured to funnel &#34;the whispers of Khnum&#34;, which allowed him to control rats, bugs, and other vermin. He complains about its lack of finesse, but there's enough here to detail how to enact this yourself if you have the dagger and medallion.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Unlike the Book of Eibon, which seemed to have a breakdown on how to cast its spell, Carmen feels she'd have to put together the spell. It's something she could try to put together in the future, re-reading the book with the intent to learn more about the inner workings of Corbitt's magic. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl takes a trowel out to one of the local cemetaries and, when nobody is looking, buries the mason jar of ashes.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl trains his Spot Hidden through the most grueling of regimens: puzzle boxes and Where's Waldo books. Over the course of several months, he gets pretty into it, progressing from a mere novice to something of an amateur. It helps that the orphans are super into it as well, and it becomes sort of a game at his workplace
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato trains his ability to Dodge through a pretty active regimen of aerobics. He takes up a class for it, working on his flexibility and balance so he's better able to bend out of the way of otherworldly horrors. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It's a few months down the line before the three of you receive a little letter in the mail, an invitation to dinner with Nina Richards of &#34;The Society for the Exploration of the Unexplained&#34;. The letter reads:
</p>
<p class="gmtext">&#34;To Mr Carl Handy, Ms Carmen Santiago, and Professor ???? Plato (the first name is smudged out, unfortunately), We would like to cordially invite you to dine this weekend with us at the Willie Whitley Gallery to discuss interests which would certainly be to your interests. Please RSVP when available, -- Ms Nina Richards&#34;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Nina Richards is a middle-aged black woman with her hair pulled back into a floofy ponytail. She's seated at a table for four, and welcomes the group over. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The gallery itself is pretty full, they've got an art showing going on this weekend but also have an attached restaurant. Lots of private parties booking tables and tours, though Nina's only booked the table in the corner. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Nina holds out a newspaper article. &#34;NEWLY REFURBISHED, RECENTLY UNHAUNTED, CONTACT STEPHEN KNOTT FOR GREAT PRICES&#34;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group huddles for a bit, and a few minutes later Nina returns from the wash to listen to their story. They go over their supernatural escapades; the research they'd looked up on the house, the man appearing for a moment in their midst and the Professor's mental break, the bed, the rat attack, the fire bucket, and culiminating with the secret room and the undead(?) man within. Nina remains fascinated the whole time.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">They leave out the Chapel, the Liber Ivonis, and the things they took from the house.

Additionally, they included a copy of the letter they received from the original client.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">According the SEU's addendum, they expect this to take probably two days, one to get out there and assess the books and then another to head back. They're planning to book you for the weekend, though, getting you out there Friday and then heading back Sunday.

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Click on the Player-&#62;Characters button on the right hand side. You should see a character there with your name on it, do you see it?
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: found it
</p>
<p class="gmtext">To roll your stats, left click a d6 to pick it up. Then, right click twice to duplicate it twice. Take those 3d6 and throw them into the chat window
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: i c i c 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You begin with 3d6x5 STR, so in your case you begin with 70 STR
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: then does it go down and to the right or to the right and down? 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The 70 represents your total Strength. In order to succeed with a Strength Check, you must roll under your Strength. Double click the 70 to roll a Strength Check
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: ah okie it kinda works like uh
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: dark heresey 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Some things are more difficult than others, like bursting through a barricaded door vs a normal door. The 35 represents the threshold for this &#34;Hard Success&#34; (1/2 your STR), and the 14 represents the threshold for an &#34;Extreme Success&#34; (1/5 of your STR)
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: ah okie 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Roll another 3d6 for your CON
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: not great!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Roll 2d6 for your SIZ and add two
</p>
<p class="gmtext">*add six
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">SIZ represetns your size, a combination of both height and weight.

<p class="gmtext">SIZ represetns your size, a combination of both height and weight. It can manifest in whichever combination you want. Your Size is 55.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Roll 3d6 for your DEX
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Roll 3d6 for your APP. Appearance represents both physical attractiveness and personality, in whichever way you want it to manifest
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: yeah that seems right
</p>
<p class="gmtext">INT represents intelligence, which is your quick-wittedness. Roll 2d6+6 for that
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: no no this is pretty average for me rolling a new character for the first time 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">POW is your Power, your force of will and how much mental vitality you have. Roll 3d6 for that. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">EDU represents book learning and formal education, stuff that's good on Jeopardy. Roll 2d6+6 for that
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I should roll another 45
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: yeah lol 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">And finally, roll 3d6 for your LUCK stat
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: lmao
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Luck is unique. Luck is used both for determining targets for monsters (sometimes) and for determining things that you don't really have any control over.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You can find the stat under the normal stats, to the far right
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Any time you make a roll, you can permanently reduce your LUCK by an amount to improve your roll by that much. This can turn a failure into a success
</p>
<p class="gmtext">As an alternative, any non-combat roll can be Pushed. If you Push a roll then you get a free reroll! However, if you fail a Pushed roll, then it counts as a Complication, which I can use to make bad things happen to you. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: If that would be necessary otherwise I don't mind rolling with it and dying if it comes to that 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I can work with this otherwise 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Death may come for you anyways, but if you'd like you can distribute 90 points among your stats (maximum of 80 in any single skill)
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Entertainers gain a number of Occupation Skill Points equal to twice their EDU plus twice their APP, so you'll want higher values in those. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: are my skills that much noticeable lower than everyone elses ;w; 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: noticeably*
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: ahhh
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I suppose that is a bit lower then
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: and that app and edu score is a pretty big hinderance
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: &#60;3
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: Thats good!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: okie
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I added 45 points
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: okie
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I added 70 points total. I don't mind being at a slight disadvantage 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: makes me think more
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Your secondary characteristics are below and to the right of your main attributes
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Hit Points are how many hit points you have. 0 is dying. If you take 5 or more at once, you suffer a Major Wound and have additional debuffs (broken leg, maimed hand, etc)
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Sanity is how mentally sound you are. Whenever you spot something supernatural, you'll roll vs your Sanity to avoid losing your cool and/or going insane
</p>
<p class="gmtext">DB is a Damage Bonus for your size and strength, which is added to melee attacks. This is represented by your Build. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Pop over to Skills here, and click the blue pencil toward the top
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: okie!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">As an Entertainer, you have Art/Craft (Acting), Disguise, Listen, and Psychology as Occupation Skills. (Psychology is Sense Motive)
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: Interpersonal I'll probably do Charm and persuade
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: Then probably stealth and uh
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Melee attacks in this are opposed rolls. When attacked, the defender can opt to Dodge or Fight Back. If they Dodge, they only have to roll an equal level of success to the attack roll to dodge it. If they Fight Back, they have to roll one level higher, but if they win then they deal damage. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: hmm
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Ln is for selecting secondary languages. Ar for arts. Ft for fighting skills (melee). Sc for science skills. And Fr for firearm skills
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: probably like a vaudville assistant. The girl that gets tied to the spinning wheel and or ties crowd participants to the wheel 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: circus performer
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: actually
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: I think I'll do first aid 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Each skill starts off with a Base score. For example, Operate Heavy Machinery starts at only a 1% level of success, but you can increase that on a 1:1 basis with your 220 Occupation Points. In contrast, First Aid starts at 30% and you can do the same. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You also have 110 Personal Interest points that can be spent on anything you want
</p>
<p class="gmtext">I'd recommend to try and have at least three skills above 50% by the end of this, if not more. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: okie
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Now you have 110 points to spend on any skills you want 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: okie dokie!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Perfect! Click the blue pen again to turn off Edit mode and we've got your skills set up
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Any time you succeed in a skill check, check off the box next to it. You have a chance at improving that skill in between adventures
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: ooo

<p class="gmtext">Click on Inventory next
</p>
<p class="gmtext">In the bottom right is your Wealth. Spending Level means that you can buy anything worth under $10 and not have to record spending for it. Cash represents how much money you have on your person at any given time. And Assets represent the value of your belongings in general, stuff you could sell off for cash if you need. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">However, in general, you cna start off with any items in your inventory that you generally would have. I leave that to your discretion and reserve the right to reject it if you say you have 50 war hounds 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya c:: lol
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Anything you *don't* put in there, you can make a Luck roll to retroactively have. As long as it's reasonable. A Luck check to see if you remembered to bring a flashlight or some rope or handcuffs
</p>

<p class="gmtext">The cityscape slowly gives way to countryside as the group travels out from Boston toward the sleepy little town of Gamwell. Surrounded by little more than farms, the town's only ever really used by the locals or as a quick pitstop for travellers. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The road traveling through the town is the only one of note. Along it, a general store boasts the only filling station for miles. There's a small series of buildings along one side of the road, including &#34;Dodge, Dodge, and Dodge&#34;, &#34;The Gamwell Gazette&#34;, and &#34;PO LICE&#34;. The most stand-out building is the small chapel at the far end of town, a whitewashed stone building. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The letter from the Socieity of the Exploration of Unexplained had mentioned that the books had been transferred from Cornthwaite's mansion to the local church, and that they had someone there already who'd been categorizing them.

<p class="gmtext">The brothers look at each other, exchanging maybe a dozen or two glances before looking back at the group

<p class="gmtext">From a glance, you'd estimate that maybe 30% of their space here is devoted to stuff that Cornthwaite's done. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking through his records of his most recent trip, Carl notices something weird. The trip down to Peru is highly detailed, with people and supplies and numbers and addresses. But the trip back has a lot of voided payments and refunds. It looks like his return two months ago really only paid for the return passage for one person. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There's one more thing that sticks out among the receipts, and that's on one of the most recent orders. The professor picks up a small slip of typed paper which has a receipt for an entire truck of salt on it; unsigned, indicating it hasn't been paid for yet. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The receipt is local, from a Boston company, and is dated as having arrived Tuesday, September 15th, just a few days ago. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The receipts do seem to confirm this, he definitely didn't ship back a lot of stuff with him. It was just payment for his personal voyage
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group exits the little law firm, looking around this nice warm September day. Free to travel wherever they want!

<p class="gmtext">The sheriff is typing up a report as the investigators enter the little office. It's one of those combination office/jail buildings, with the cage sitting to the right of the sheriff's desk. The name tag on his desk says &#34;Sheriff William Whitford&#34;. He's a good looking, solidly built man. He's got a collar and a tie, with a dark jacket that his sheriff's badge is attached to. His hair is cut short, oiled in place, and shot through with grey. He glances up as you enter. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It's early afternoon right now
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group heads back outside, the directions to Cornthwaite's estate in hand. It's not too far, maybe a 30min walk or a 5min drive. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The newspaper office is small and cluttered. There's two desks set up, both covered in papers and notes. The man at the desk smiles at you widely, chubby cheeks dimpling. He's in a bright red and green checked suit, is clean shaven, and has a panama hat covering thick chestnut hair. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking through the papers, the group find occasional mentions of Cornthwaite. It's harder to keep track of them all than it is to find them. But none are particularly interesting. THey talk about opening fetes, attening tea parties, donating to the church, winning at a local bridge night, giving books to the church/library, and so on.

<p class="gmtext">Chatting with Sam, there doesn't seem to be much about Arthur. He seems omnipresent in the little town, but at the same time he seems distant. The conversation drifts away from him and goes to the house, which apparently has a bit of a history.

<p class="gmtext">The group heads back next door to the Sheriff's office, and Sheriff Whitford raises an eyebrow at the group. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">A shadow seems to go over the man's expression as he leans forward, frowning. He's got a haunted look in his expression. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The flowers that the pastor's wife put out the other day are making a little more sense to Lillian
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Thinking back, Lillian recalls something else that the pastor had mentioned in passing: &#34;Poor man's been struggling with his guilt for months now.&#34; When pressed on this, he seemed a bit sheepish and said he couldn't say anything more, shouldn't have said that much. What's told in confession is intended to be in confidence, after all. 
</p>
<h3>Session Date: 2025-04-19</h3>
<p class="gmtext">Last time, our group of investigators arrived in the little town of Gamwell. They discussed details on the books with the lawyers, about local going-ons with the sheriff, and about events with the newspapers. Once finding out about the old murders, the group revisited the Sheriff and found that it was he who found the massacre 30 years ago. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group's got almost all of the books, but a few special interest books don't appear to be present in those brought to the church for donation. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">These books are: De Occulta Philosophia, The Missing People: The Tribe that the Jungle Swallowed, The Antiquities of Mexico, Secret Teachings of All Ages, and The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The Father leads the group back into the little graveyard. He leads them to two batches, one with the graves of Elma Fitzgerald (1865), Albert Fitzgerald (1865), Simon Fitzgerald (1865), and Grace Fitzgerald (1865), and then the other with the graves of Gloria Curwen (1895) and a single large tombstone for Harold, Sarah, and Susan Curwen (1895).
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The graves for Harold, Sarah, and Susan have flowers on them. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It's a pretty quiet day out, but unfortunately there's nothing extra of note with the scene. All are graves long since buried. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl does note a shovel sitting out by a shed
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Flashback: The professor picks up a small slip of typed paper which has a receipt for an entire truck of salt on it; unsigned, indicating it hasn't been paid for yet. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Father Haggarty continues upon his business, allowing the group to make their way back toward the town, and toward the house if they'd like. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group piles into Carl's little truck. The back of it is full of various tools and materials for the man's carpentry. The truck's only realy made to seat two, maybe three, in the cab. It can fit all four of you if you sit kinda uncomfortably, or one or more can ride in the back.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The trip along the road isn't too eventful, and it's not long before the group's directions lead them to the old manse. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Despite it's dark past, the Fitzgerald Estate sits in a peaceful countryside. Resting on nearly 20 acres of woodland and rolling hills, the house itself is bordered bya high stone wall topped with iron spikes. Peering through the locked gates, our intrepid investigators look upon a tangled mess of a garden, stirring in a chill autumn breeze.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The iron gate providing access to the driveway is padlocked. Looking through shows the wide driveway which leads toward the house, while other ill-defined plants lead off into the rambling garden. The house is visible ahead through the riot of plant life. Unfortunately, the key ring only contains keys to the front and back door. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The main walkway up toward the house is clear, but the little side paths appear to be choked with weeds and long grasses. It's hard to tell when it was last tended, but you'd guess it's been months since anyone did gardening here. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">While the fence does have spikes up top, there's also plenty of trees growing up and over the fence. It'd be easy to climb over
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Swinging back, the lawyers are excessively apologetic about forgetting to give you the main key. They're really quite sheepish about the whole thing.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Heading back down to the house, the group can unlock the gate (finally) and drive their car up that quaint little driveway
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It looks like the Fitzgerald Estate came with an extensive garden, though it's clear that Cornthwaite's gardener has not tended to it in quite some time. Stone benches, planters, and even a fountain are all choked with weeds and plants. The trees include several exotic varieties, such as willows and chery plums. It's a wild expanse of runaway foliage, aggressively overgrown. It's a dark, dank green.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house itself is silent, shuttered, and brooding. Cobwebbed by ivy, masked by trees, and caressed by the wind. It is large and apparently well-constructed, with high ceilings and thick, substantial windows, walls, and doors. From the outside, the entire edifice presents a strange, slightly skewed or tilted appearance. The foundations seem solid enough when viewed closely, but the house itself seems a little... crooked.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house has two stories, with doors front and (presumably) back. The front door waits atop a short flight of steps. The door is carved oak, the fine brass knocker cold to the touch. The windows are potential points of entry, but are currently shuttered. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Also, you guys can split the party c:
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The property's foliage seems unusually green to everyone in the group. Carmen, Plato, and Handy note how thereh's a lot more leaves and foliage cover in here than there was along the route. Lillian notices mostly that the leaves keep finding their way to her face, the result of unfortunate wind gusts and Carl not checking behind him twice when he pushed vines out of the way. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The garden path circles the property, giving an angle on all sides of the house. The windows around the house are all shuttered shut. You make note of a the back door, as well as a pair of wooden hatches at the rear of the property to give access to the wood cellar.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">On either side of the path, greenery chokes the space and encroaches in what was once a spacious walkway. It's hard to walk down without pushing leaves out of the way. A small garden shed comes into view, green paint peeling and its door slightly ajar. Beyond it, blocking the rest of the loop, it seems a tree has finally succumb to some sort of fungal infection and fallen across. It's covered in mushrooms, which have practically burst fourth to spread through the surrounding foliage.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Inside, the shed is dark, and a carpet of leaves and detritus cover the floor. There are lots of tools: rakes, a wheelbarrow, shovels, some hedge-clippers, a pick, a saw, and so on&#8212;many of these have fallen to the floor. All are disused and a little dirty, and some are a little rusty.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking through the shed, the one thing that sticks out is an empty rack. It appears someone has taken an axe, and hasn't put it back. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">There's definitely rope back in the truck. 
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The group circles back around, heading toward the truck to grab some rope. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Can I have everyone roll an INT check for me?
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Carl and Plato don't hear anything. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Heading back to grab their ropes (and/or Molotovs), the group is prepared for further exploration. How do they enter this forboding abode?
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Make an INT check to examine the door
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Looking closely, the Professor doesn't think there's any sign of forced entry. The lock's not new, but it's not excessively scratched up like one might expect from a forced lock. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The knock is loud and hollow. But nobody seems to respond. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The key fits in easily, clicking and allowing Carmen to swing the door open
</p>
<p class="gmtext">As the front door unlocks and slides open, the first thing that hits you is the scent. The house has a strong odor to it, like mildew or mold. The interior is dark, all the shutters preventing most of the light from making it in.

<p class="gmtext">To the right, the parlour has what was once a nice sitting place, now clearly ruined. Water has dripped down from the ceiling, and most of the couches and chairs now look rather soggy. A few basic hunting trophies sit around the room on the walls.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">A large area with a pool table and, a polished wooden floor. Water damage is visible all throughout the fine hardwood, leading over into the adjacent room. A corner bookshelf sits empty, all its books relocated to town.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl heads into the moist parlour and opens up the windows and shutters, allowing a bit of air in. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato does note that there's some more modern furniture. He doesn't recognize any specific brands, but the chairs remind him of the chairs his office got up at the University. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The wind outside picks up, and the whole house seems to creek
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Listen Checks please
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">There is a stairwell in the professor's line of sight. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There is no current water dripping, but you can see the stains in the ceing. Extensive stains, a lot of them. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking closely at the fireplace, Carmen doesn't spot anything. Not looking closely at the fireplace, Carl spots a book sitting open on a desk in the next room. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The study has several empty bookshelves in it, as well as a large roll-top desk and some filing cabinets. A big comfy chair sits in front of the desk, with a few less comfy chairs surrounding a table. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lifting up the book, it has the title &#34;The Missing People: The Tribe That The Jungle Swallowed&#34;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">De Occulta Philosophia (Trophy Room on display)&#10;The Missing People: The Tribe that the Jungle Swallowed (Study)&#10;The Antiquities of Mexico (Library)&#10;Secret Teachings of All Ages (Library)&#10;The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion (His room)&#10;&#10;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">De Occulta Philosophia &#10;The Missing People: The Tribe that the Jungle Swallowed &#10;The Antiquities of Mexico &#10;Secret Teachings of All Ages &#10;The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion &#10;&#10;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The walls and ceiling both show clear signs of water damage, with the wallpaper peeling off. The table has a clear series of stains
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It was open to the start of Chapter 8: Local Rumors, Myths, and Teachings
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The filing cabinets seem to contain various notes and accounting, including previous expeditions. The drawyers of the desk has more domestic details, as well as office supplies. No new books turn up. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The expedition appears to have a ton of details going into it, ranging from travel to food to transportation to money for hiring on locals. Previous expeditions show some significant returns, but the most recent one has... nothing. There's no shipping of crates, no orders for special storage, no special mail forms, nothing.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">According to the papers Carmen has, the expedition was down to Lima, Peru in South America. There are arrangements to travel from there to other, less recognized towns. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">A hallway leads toward the back door, light filtering in through its little window. To the left, the space beneath the stairwell is filled with junk, boxes, barrels, crates, and so on. A large area of mold and moisture can be seen in the center of the floor.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The floor in the center of the hall there definitely feels week enough that putting your weight on it would be very bad.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There is a silver service laid out: a table for one. There are thin slivers of broken glass on the floor here, with a little silver tray beside it that's maybe 6in long and 2in wide. The walls are cracked and moist.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking at the pepper shaker, it looks like whoever threw it down on the gorund did not do so in anger. It appears to have been sort of passively discarded. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Empty disused tubs with odd sediments fill the little laundry room. Water damage is present on the ceiling.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl notices that the outfits here are all men's outfits, and they're all about the right sizes. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">*rights sizes to belong to a single person
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Yes, the passport's stamps do line up with what was found in the records. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The residue is a bit oily, giving a sheen to the tubs. A light coating. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house creaks in the wind, and the wind blows in through the dining room and into the study. It catches the door, slamming it shut
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The boy doesn't respond, opting to quietly remain out of sight
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There's nothing under the table, save for chairs and table legs and the sparkle of broken glass. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house creaks again, and it almost sounds like footsteps on the stairs, somewhere. ~th-thump th-thump th-thump th-thump~
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Elma Fitzgerald (1865), Albert Fitzgerald (1865), Simon Fitzgerald (1865), Grace Fitzgerald (1865), Gloria Curwen (1895), Harold, Sarah, and Susan Curwen (1895)
</p>
<p class="gmtext">A stovetop fireplace sits against one wall, with shelves, cupboards, and a sink lining the rest. On the shelf above the stove, there is a series of four metal canisters labeled flour, sugar, tea, and coffee, with a space between the tea and coffee large enough for another can.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">A piece of plaster has fallen off the wall and looks damp to the touch. To the south, there are three doors, and an open door to the north leading to the summer kitchen.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Opening the stove, there's only a few pots and pans within. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The breeze after opening the windows in the kitchen is a relief
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen can't make out the words, but if y'all go closer you might be able to
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Out to the west window, you can see there's steps leading up to a little porch
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There's a hole exposing the bricks and insulation
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The second door opens up to a little pantry space, which immediately hits everyone with the smell of rot. The water damage is in here too, and it soaked through the food supplies. It's all gone bad
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The third door is stuck. The water damage has caused it to swell, leaving the door stuck in its frame.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">And the final door opens to...
</p>
<p class="gmtext">...the hallway from earlier
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Behind the four of you, a small girl is standing in the corner of the kitchen. Maybe 8 or 9 years old, she still clings to an old fashioned doll.

</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group stands in the kitchen of the old, water-damaged house, light filtering in from the windows to light it up.

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The girl doesn't seem to meet Carmen's eyes, looking instead to a point behind and through her
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Wind blows through the open windows, a soft howl sounding through the room
</p>
<p class="gmtext">She cuts herself off there, and it's a very sudden sort of movement. She seems a little off, but it's hard to put your fingers on.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Harder too, for Lillian, as she reaches over and puts her hand straight through the girl. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The girl turns and runs, pushing literally through the rest of Lillian and through the open doorway to the hall. As she passes into the shadows, you lose sight of her. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Two doors lie open, one to the hall and the other to the laundry room. The door to the pantry, due to the stench, is being kept closed. The remaining door, likely to the basement, is stuck shut. The water damage has caused the wood of the door to swell. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">A small linen closet is revealed, full of crusty old linens.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Unfortunately, without touching them, you can't really tell if they've got a mineral buildup or something else going on with them. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Scraping at it with a screwdriver, it seems to come off in little flakes. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Just more sheets and the like. It's a pretty standard linen closet. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Heading up the stairs, the group enters a small hallway. To the north is just darkness, only lit up by your flashlights. But you can see hints of light to the south where a window is shuttered closed. The wind outside seems to make the building creek, almost as if it were breathing.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The cigarette smoke is a welcome change of pace to the smell of the house. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">With the window finally open, you're able to get a breath of fresh air in here, and some light
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Down to the south, Carmen discovers the other stairwell, a little balcony overlookiong the staircase. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There's no sign of any source of water damage here, though you can see signs of it in the ceiling and walls. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The bathroom is luxurious, with a large tub and shower and fine engravings. Even the tub has a layer of dust on it.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Oddly enough, the tub itself has dust in it, suggesting that it hasn't been used for weeks. There do not appear to be any medications behind the mirror, nor is there anything unusual beneath the sink
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Once containing books on exploration, archaeology, history, anthropology, and more, the shelves lie largely bare. Along one wall, the books shelves are full, but mold and moisture are noticeable among the books. Water damage is present on the walls and ceiling.
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Carmen heads directly over to the books, sorting through them to see what she can find.

<p class="gmtext">Carmen heads directly over to the books, sorting through them to see what she can find. And find something she does, as two titles stick out to her. &#34;Secret Teachings of All Ages&#34; and &#34;The Antiquities of Mexico&#34;
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group hears a little yelp from the far side of the room, and Lillian is gone. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato sees what the others miss as they're fumbling around on the bookshelf. A Lillian-hand shaped print on the back wall of the fireplace. Pressing into it carefully, the wall swings in to a small hidden room. This one is very barebones, not adorned with anything.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Well, except for Lillian, and the rotting body underneath her. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The body is well decayed, mostly bones by now. Its fingerbones are broken, and a fair distance away from it is an old axe.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian is shaking as she's pulled free and finds her breath
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The body is about 30-years rotted. There's no window in this room, and you find the fingers are broken apart. Looking on the back of the stone wall, you find debris that's pretty indicative of what used to be fingernails, as well as blood, from when the man was clawing at the door. It seems it doesn't open from this side, only the other side. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">This one is just a hatch, so you'll need someone or something to boost you up. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There's a small closet there, though nothing really special within there. Just a few supplies and book-person paraphernalia
</p>
<p class="gmtext">This one opens up another linen closet, this one full of sheets and blankets as opposed to tablecloths and the like. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There is a small red ball sitting in the hallway now. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The door to the west is locked, and the keys provided don't work on it. It seems that it's not one that Cornthwaite provided a key for. The other door, while it has a lock, isn't actually locked, and opens up for you. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It is just a small, red, rubber ball
</p>
<p class="gmtext">This expensively-furnished room contains much in the way of clothing and personal effects, including a god-plated cigar case and a diamond tiepin. The ceiling of this room is moist, and water occasionally drips from its center.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The fireplace also shows moisture around its edges. Directly in front of the fireplace is a pair of fluffy blue men&#8217;s slippers.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The slippers are facing toes away from the fireplace
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Pouring the water on there, it does seem to dissolve like salt. You imagine that there could be other substances, but salt is by far the most likely given what you've seen. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">No, it's only in front of the door, the windows, and the closet
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Opening up the closet, you find a lot of menswear. Unlike the rest of this house, these at least aren't waterlogged. They are, however, in various states of unwashed despite being hung up.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Sifting through the closet, nothing really sticks out in here other than the occasional AC embroidered on the robes and outfits. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking through the rest of the room, the group doesn't see anything in particular in here.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Heading over to the bathroom gain, Carl turns the faucet on. It gurgles for a moment, but nothing comes out. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The cigar case is expensive-looking, but seems to just hold a few cigars in it. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The wall does seem to be pretty standard. There don't appear to be any weirdness in there.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen steps outside of the room, and looks down toward Carl. Carl is leaning over to look down the hall, meeting Carmen's eye for a second
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen checks both ways, and it's only on the second check to the south the figure duck into the room on the west. It looks like an older boy. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen is dry
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking up at the ceiling, Carmen and the professor see that there's a notable wet stain above where the professor was. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">when you dry to spell the word correctly :c
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">One book that she finds is the Golden Bough. The other is what appears to be a personal diary, hand written
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The pages before this seem to be talking about how excited Cornthwaite is to be going out to their site. It seems they only had a day left before arriving to their destination, on the page before the last two entries. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The pair step out into the hallway, reuiniting with their companions before any of them get got
</p>
<p class="gmtext">This is a simple and modest bedroom with two beds set up, as well as wardrobes and an open closet. Water appears to have leaked across the celing and down onto the beds, ruining them both. It's empty, except for a wet blouse on the floor. A vanity desk and mirror, alongside an empty makeup kit on the desk, suggest it to be a woman's room.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The closet and one wardrobe appear mostly empty, with only a single wet blouse on the floor of the closet. The other wardrobe is full.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The vanity desk contains a makeup kit and perfume. However, the bottles of perfume themselves, and the nail polish jars, are missing. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The fireplace seems normal from Carl's poking
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group steps back out into the hall. Wind blows through the open windows, giving a fresh breeze as the building creaks softly. Something elsewhere in the house seems to thunk. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Another sparcely decorated room, this waterstained bedroom appears to have been repurposed. The bed has been shoved to the corner, and a table moved to the center. A black powder sits in nine neat little piles on the edge of the desk, next to an empty salt shaker. Similarly, a couple of mostly empty containers of cleaning solutions lay discarded on the ground.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aside from that, this room has a desk and a few photographs on top. They mostly depict the same man with a great big bushy beard, alongside a number of other boys, girls, men, and women who seem to share a family resemblence.
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Also, for an unrelated reason, Listen Checks from y'all
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Three of you hear someone knocking on the door downstairs. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking out the window, you can see the porch roof. Again, you can hear the knock, almost easier to hear through the window
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The knocking on the door stops
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Stepping off the porch and looking up, the man shields his eyes so he can see you. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">He's fairly well dressed, and has an axe over his shoulder. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Joe appears to be pretty sincerely confused with the Arthur comment
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Indeed, there was another guy working for the newspaper by the name of Joe Virelli, and now that you think about it you saw the name printed on a lot of the news papers y'all had to delve through. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You can't really speak to the integrity of the roof, but at least it's not as bad as the interior
</p>
<p class="gmtext">He didn't say anything back to y'all, but you can't see him
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It's been a good 30s now, and he's not come up the stairs yet. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Yeah, there's a little pull-down attic hatch that you can pull and get a ladder. You could tie any rope to that
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You could use the bedroom, tie a rope to the bed, and then climb out of one of those windows onto the little roof
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Peeking down from the roof, Lillian can confirm that the axe is sitting outside. The door's left open as well, and there's no sign of an axe murderer (nor of Joe Virelli)
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Unfortunately, you can't really tell from afar and upside down like this
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian can hear the sounds of drawers opening and closing
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The little girl from the kitchen, Grace, is standing at the far side of the room. She holds a finger up to her lips, then turns and runs down the little side hallway. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The downstairs area
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen and Carl head downstairs, the two of them finding Joe over in the Study. He's only lightly shifting through stuff on the desk. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Meanwhile, upstairs...
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Another sparcely decorated room, this waterstained bedroom appears to have been repurposed. The bed has been shoved to the corner, and a table moved to the center. A black powder sits in nine neat little piles on the edge of the desk, next to an empty salt shaker. Similarly, a couple of mostly empty containers of cleaning solutions lay discarded on the ground.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aside from that, this room has a desk and a few photographs on top. They mostly depict the same man with a great big bushy beard, alongside a number of other boys, girls, men, and women who seem to share a family resemblence.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There are several glass containers here from the vanity set, but they don't seem to be full of their normal contents. Given the containers nearby, they seem to be storing cleaning solutions like bleach and vinegar. Looking closely at the powder, the professor is pretty sure this is gunpowder. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Checking out the bed, Lillian notices several unusual stains on it, as well as a pile of salt around a clean section of the bed
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Back Downstairs...
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The reporter eagerly joins the group, heading upstairs with them to join their companions. 
</p>
<h3>Session Date: 2025-05-03</h3>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Just a quick announcement here: I got some feedback from y'all, and I want to adjust how we do our exploration and fact-finding. 
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">One common point is that there's a bit of difficulty with order of actions and with more tension. So to address those I want to implement Turns, similar to OD&#38;D
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">One Turn is 30min, and allows you to do a thorough search. You can do a sped up search in 15min if you accept +1P (one penalty die) for your roll. Spending a Turn looking things over suggests a more thorough investigation than just glancing around. 
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">This will both ensure that all four players are able to do something (rather than one player getting accidentally steamrolled) and also put a bit of a cost on your searches
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">You could all spend a Turn searching Cornthwaite's room, but that means we go from 4:00pm to 4:30pm. If you all fail, you can do it again, but then it goes from 4:30pm to 5:00pm
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">This should also encourage splitting up, since reasonably you don't need four of you doing a search in one room to expect at least one success
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Though if you want to, you absolutely can, it'll just take twice as long
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">If you have two or more people searching a room, you can split the work up to make it go faster. One person checks one half, and the other person checks the other half, and it takes half as long. BUT, if someone misses their roll on the upper half, y'all may miss information that is hidden their (ie the secret fireplace)
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The group gathers up on the upper balcony, with a new addition of a Mr Joe Virelli. Carmen catches the Professor and Lillian up as they join in. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Y'all know that Joe's been with the Gamwell Gazette for probably 10 years, or at least he's been writing articles for them for that long. You had to go through a lot of his stuff when looking for facts about Cornthwaite
</p>
<p class="gmtext">As if to back him up, the building creeks softly
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It doesn't take too long before Carmen's able to undo the old lock, and Carl slides the door open
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Inside, gathering dust, are loot from tombs the world over: pots, vases, statuettes, carvings, musical instruments, idols, and more. Some seem to leer and snicker at you in the gloom. A couple have already been smashed into unrecognizable fragments. All stare with painted outrage, flat eyes hostile to the men who removed them from their ancestral homes. Sitting on a propped up spot is a leather-bound book; De Occulta Philosophia etched in the front.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The book is easily retrieved from its stand. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The southern door opens to a small closet, which seems to have a number of exploration outfits on it. The sort of thing that one might wear down in the jungle. There are several empty hangers, though, as if some of the outfits are missing
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking through the artifacts, the Professor can't spot any that were added recently. There's a few spots open, as if room was left open for them, but the dust on them indicate that nothing had ever been placed here. It seems like Cornthwaite didn't put anything in here after his last trip, and maybe hadn't even been in here in months. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl notices that there's a rack for a rifle or shotgun. It's empty at the moment, its gun missing in action. There's also an empty box of cartridges for a shotgun.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen just keeps noticing the different eyes. Even the water damage on the walls and ceiling seem to form faces in the gloom, looking down on the group.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">(To add to the Professor's roll): While it looks like none of the trophies have been dusted or touched, there are some light signs of other presence. Of particular note, it does look like someone went into the drawyer for the box of bullets, and relatively recently. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">RETCON: The nine piles on the table were little piles of lead pellets, rather than gunpowder
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">There is a second container of bullets as well, this one full, and thus plenty of gunpowder for the professor to gather if he'd like
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The ladder to the stairs creaks loudly as it comes down, audible to all the people on the top floor. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian is on the bed, with Joe helping stabilize her as she stands on the frame to peek at the highest part of the wall
</p>
<p class="gmtext">In his defense, Joe is standing next to the bed, one hand up for her to hold and the other hand ready to catch her if she falls
</p>
<p class="gmtext">This open space contains lots of junk, from each of the families who have lived here. There are old chests, a rocking horse, a broken mirror, a locked wardrobe, a tailor&#8217;s dummy, odd bits of furniture, and so on. The only significant water damage appears to be along the floors, rather than the ceiling.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group splits up a bit, covering more ground through the the small paths. The furniture is a mix of eras, some being old fashioned stuff from the 1800s and others being more recent. It appears mostly the stuff on the west side is more old, and the stuff on the east side is more new. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The light that filters in from the vents is barely enough to see, but the intrepid investigators has some flashlights. It seems like a lot of the furniture and boxes have an almost shiny sheen to them, an irridescent reflection. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Interestingly, as the group makes it toward the north end of the attic space, one trunk has been absolutely flattened outwards. Burst as if an explosion had taken place in its interior. The inside are the remains of jungle clothing; a pith helmet, a compass, a .45 revolver, and a machete. This stuff in particular is very shiny, though dry to the touch. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Picking up the compass, Carmen holds it level. Rather than pointing north, it seems to slowly spin around as if undecided. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The gun is not loaded, though you recall that there may have been a box of ammo for the pistol downstairs as well.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">looking over the scene, the Professor notices several details. The area close to the suitcase has a more noticeable sheen, but the area outside of it isn't consistent. It's almost a... splash of it, striking out along the ground and hitting the wall and the boxes and couch that are nearby. It's as if it built up pressure from within with some sort of fluid from within, then burst free. Picking up a set of pants, it looks like it may have come from those. The pocket is torn apart. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Peeking underneath, the Lillian does see stickers and labels that identify it as belonging to Arthur Cornthwaite, and show that it's been to South America and back several times. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Checking by the spot on the wall, Carmen doesn't notice any specific holes in the wall. However, the wall boards aren't always flush against one another, likewise with the floor boards in places. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house creeks in the wind
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Not so much, though the walls here are just bare wood rather than being plaster
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Nothing that  the group has encountered so far, especially the stuff from the suitcase and its surrounding walls, seems to actually be wet to the touch. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house creeks again, the floor shaking slightly
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The compass point spins rapidly
</p>
<p class="gmtext">A box from the far side of the room falls to the ground
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">You can burn one luck to get the success, or you can push it by walking in the same direction as Lillian, just by going around the left passageway in the clutter rather than the right one
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Nice
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen steps around the other side, parallel to Lillian. She steps around the edge, looking toward the far side where the box fell. She can see it, some of the clutter having fallen away, and she can see something behind it
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Enormous and bloated, a swell of green substance rises from the floor. A nightmareish mass of abhorrent corruption, a bubbling morass of translucent greenish gel in which swirl air pockets, and sickly pus-like matter. Ghastly pink mouths and bloated black eye-like organs slowly form along the surface, gaping and blinking in and out of existence. But she can tell one locks eyes with her. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">What she doesn't see is the swell to her left, oozing out of the boards just behind her head, another tendral of the thing which lashes out and grabs her. 
</p>

</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carmen Santamonica
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Lillian Lovell
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl and the Professor both stagger back in shock at the horrifying sight, the Professor stumbling over the leg of a chair and dropping his flashlight. Carl loses his grip on his sledgehammer, which falls into a bunch of boxes. 
</p>

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carmen Santamonica
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The tentacles wiggle menacingly. The mouths along its edge open and yawn wide, as if screaming silently as it burbles. It presses in on her mouth and nose.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen pulls to break free, but the tentacle around her head pulls back with surprising force. Given the angle, she tilts forward, pulled up toward the wall where the rest of the creature awaits her
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carl Handy
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The professor swings the machete. It's a very wiggly tentacle, though, and he only clips it. It seems to ooze back together from the small cut in the aftermath, not too worse for wear
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Professor Plato
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Wiggly tentacles
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Oozing all over her face, the creature forces her mouth open and begins to push its way into her mouth, forcing more and more of it in.

<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Joe Virelli
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Lillian Lovell
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carmen Santamonica
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Pulling herself free, Carmen is finally able to free herself. The blob breaks free, and she immediately vomits the blob that had slid into her mouth. The tendrals turn their attention on Carl, Joe, and the Professor.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Lillian Lovell
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian grabs Carmen and pulls her with her down the ladder. It's more of an undignified topple than it is a graceful descent, but fortunately Lillian makes good padding.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carl Handy
</p>
<p class="gmtext">As Carl gets to the hatch, both he and the Professor notice a familiar doll sitting on the chair. The same one as the kid had earlier. They also notice the ooze pulling back in as if getting ready to lash out.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Professor Plato
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Wiggly tentacles
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The tentacles lunge out toward Joe, but the journalist deftly evades the clumsy reach
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The tentacles burst free from the wallpaper, snapping out toward Lillian and right past Carmen and the Professor. Fortunately, Lillian's helping hand on Carmen's shoulder meant that she was able to push off at the last second, landing on her butt, but not getting grabbed.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[ROUND 3]
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Joe Virelli
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carmen Santamonica

</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen rushes down the stairs, wheeling herself around the balcony before forcibly halting her momentum.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen rushes back up the stairs, then into the servent's room and makes for the window
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Lillian Lovell
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian stabs into the tentacles, but it turns out they're slime so it kind of just oozes its way back out without being pinned to the ground. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">One of the eyes blinks at her accusingly
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carl Handy
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Professor Plato
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl climbs down the hatch, watching the professor fending off the tentacles bleeding out of the wall
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It's hard for a slime monster to look even wetter, but it looks like this does the job. It doesn't seem to react to it, except to extend more questing tendrals toward the potential source.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Wiggly tentacles 2
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The wiggly tentacles leap out toward Carl. His attempts to deflect it are as pathetic as its attempt to graple it, and Lillian and the Professor watch for about four seconds as the two flail against one another, neither actually landing any hits. 
</p>

</p>
<p class="gmtext">Joe dodges the tentacles as they swish out at him, moving toward the window to safety
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Tentacles burst out of the other wall, wrapping around the man and grappling him. He lets out a terrified scream as they begin to pull him back inside.

</p>
<p class="gmtext">[ROUND 5]
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Joe Virelli
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Joe reaches out with one hand, desperately trying to get to the window. It's only with the Professor's help that he's finally able to pull free, and clambers out onto the rooftop. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carmen Santamonica
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Lillian Lovell
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian rushes over to the truck. Fortunately, Carl's got one of the older trucks that just has the little turn knob on it, rather than needing a specific key, allowing her to start it up

<p class="gmtext">Joe leaps down as well, but doesn't look before he leaps. He lands poorly, his ankle twisting and crying out in pain as he collapses in a heap on the ground.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house sits before the group, doors and windows shuttered shut. They can almost hear a slight creak of the house as the wind carries a chill through the group.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carmen Santamonica

<p class="gmtext">The group gets in the truck and heads back over toward town. Like the trip in, there's no activity in the town and no traffic on the road. The only vehicle you see is the big truck parked behind the lawyers' place. Oddly enough, the Sheriff's office is closed, door locked with nobody within.

<h3>Session Date: 2025-05-24</h3>
<p class="gmtext">With Joe having staggered into the church to go recouperate, the group finishes up their conversation with Walter Dodge, leaving him a bit deflated at not having found Cornthwaite. He heads back toward the office, running a hand through thinning hair. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The shadows grow longer as evening approaches, dusk only an hour or two away. Along the street, the Dodge's building seems to be the only one active. The sheriff's office is closed and locked, Sheriff Whitford apparently out and about. Similarly, Sam seems to have closed up the newspaper for the day as well. Even the general store seems to have closed down for the night, having served their expected clients. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">One set of words lingers between the investigators. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">You could warrant a bit more science to determine whether it's effective or not
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The dump truck full of salt is simply parked by the Dodge, Dodge, and Dodge office. You only see Walter inside, filling out some paperwork. His brothers, presumably, have either gone home or are busy elsewhere. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Heading over to the truck and peeking in the back, it looks like it's got a tarp over the back to cover the fact that it is simply a bed full of loose salt. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Fortunately, Carl does have several burlap sacks in the back of his own truck. One of them even has &#34;SALT&#34; stenciled on it from its old purpose before he began reusing it for other stuff. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group loads up four big burlap sacks full of salt, one for each person. They're pretty heavy, but seem pretty durable as well and easy to carry as long as you use two hands. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group heads back out with their newly found salt toward The Goop House&#8482;. They arrive to find it much as they left it, alone and quiet. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl looks at the camera and winks
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house looms in front of the group. Carmen approaches the front door, carefully taking hold of the handle. She braces herself, her salted companions at the ready
</p>
<p class="gmtext">She flings the door open, and a giant flood of slime and ooze with gibbering mouths and blinking eyes is conspicuously missing. The rooms sit before you much as they had before. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Previously, the group had noticed lines of salt in Cornthwaite's room upstairs. One in front of the closet, one in front of the door, and one along each windowsil. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Still, it could not have been flawless, for the man's missing.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group heads through the house, trailing salt behind them as they go. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The reverse side of the kitchen, with more lighting and an egresss. It's one of those little kitchens for use in the summer when entertaining guests in the yard. But the room is quite bare and it's clear that Cornthwaite's seen little use for it. It's got just as much staining along its ceiling and walls as the kitchen does.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Checking the door to the south of the kitchen, it does still seem to be stuck
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl pulls on the door, struggling to get it unstuck. The water damage must have done a lot of damage to the door, because Carl has to stop pulling as he hears the wood giving way around the handle. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">You can keep going if you'd like, but you run the risk of pulling the handle mechanism off the door entirely
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The house lightly creeks in the wind outside, a gust of wind flowing in from the front. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl rips the handle off, his free hand ready to throw salt through. The wood splinters a bit, and it's a good thing that the salt is thrown immediately. A tendral of ooze is already forming to kill Carl right off the bat, but as the salt hits it there's a shudder through the house. Steam billows off of the fluid surface, and it retreats  back through into the darkness on the other side. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The house creaks again, something causing the building to shudder slightly. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There is a turkey baster in the upstairs cupboard. Pulling it out and pouring some salt into a can, she turns on the water at the sink to fill it up. Nothing comes out immediately, though the faucet does rattle slightly as she waits.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It is, in fact, not water which emerges eventually. A thick goop pours out, filling the bucket. A mouth forms in the substance, letting out a horrifying scream, like that of a child on fire. The goop hisses and crackles, a billow of smoke pouring out and into Lillian's face for a moment.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian screams, inhaling a deep breath of the salty-acidic gas in her face. She coughs, staggering back, partially blinded. Carl, likewise, lets out a yelp of surprise as the thing screams, dropping his sack of salt and rupturing it. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The screaming creature whisks itself back up into the faucet, the remaining goo bubbling and seething away into nothing
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group heads out toward the cellar door. They exit the front door to grab another bag or two of salt, and head over toward the cellar door on the side of the building. The big hatch is almost completely surrounded in overgrowth from the weeds and vines growing around it. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato uses his machete like a weedwacker, slashing at the vines and overgrowth. He clears it out without having to wade through too much, finally getting access to the front door. Opening the unstuck hatch, it opens to a large staircase, leaning all the way down toward the dank dark basement. 
</p>
<h3>Session Date: 2025-06-02</h3>
<p class="gmtext">The group looks down into the stairwell, flashlights pointing down into the cellar of the house. Around them, the foliage rustles softly in the wind, the waning light of the sun indicating that the group has at least an hour until darkness. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Who wants to go down first? 
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The stairwell itself is dirt-and-wood staircase, the wood serving as a frame for the hard dirt and rock leading down to the lower levels. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl returns swiftly with several lanterns. There's a lot of things to tie the rope to outside, mostly foliage and vines.
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">You can search for a garden hose if you want, but to find it you'll need to rummage through the plant growth against the house. 
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The group ties their rope off at the top of the stairs, and have a fair length of it to hold onto and follow down with. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Flashlights put away, the group works their way down the stairs with more illumination. The kerosene lanterns spread less consistent light, but a wider arc of it.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Across the room, unusual vines and creepers have emerged from a great mound of wood and sawdust. They spill forth from the mound, filling the room despite the darkness. Barely visible through the vines and growths, you can see a door on the far side of the room. Above you, you can see clear indication
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Above you, you can see clear indication of water damage along the wood in the floor. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The ground below is dirt, but everything in the room has a shiney sheen to it. The walls, the floor, the ceiling. Even the plants glisten in the darkness, as if wet. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The salt sprinkles pleasantly against the plants, and fortunately they don't scream or attack or anything. They seem unbothered and unresponsive to it.
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Yeah, you can Push the roll if you want to wander closer, perhaps pushing your way past the outter portions of the foliage to get a better view of the center bulk
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Pushing her way into the foliage, Carmen stumbles a little bit on the vines. Some of the ones down below have a sort of sticky set of hairs to them, almost like velcro, which catch on her pants legs and shoestrings. She doesn't notice any active movements in the process, and certainly doesn't feel anything sliding up her pants legs. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Go for it; what sorta roll do you want to make?

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian Lovell [English]: These are plants!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Clear options would include trying to rummage through that giant pile of wood and vines, or to just head toward the door. There doesn't seem to be much else in here. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The holy salt water is thrown upon the plants, splashing against them. None of the plants seem to react, other than dripping passively. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There's some helpful vines dangling from the ceiling which work really well to hold the lantern up, or she can stick it on one of the hooks near a wall. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The room is salted
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It is also fairly well lit now!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Basement stairs tend to just be straight, and this doorway is in the wrong spot and facing the wrong direction for that. If he were to guess, this leads to a second room, which itself has the stairwell in it. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen heads up to the door. It's water damaged, similar to the door in the kitchen, and also seems to have swelled to the point where it can't open.
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">You'll have to make a STR check to force it open
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian Lovell [English]: I can give it a go 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The door doesn't budge on the first time, nor on the second, but it does on the third! Carmen and Lillian yank it free with an audible *SCHLUCK* sound, and the wall of slime on the other side pours into the room toward both of the women.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Lillian Lovell
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carmen Santamonica
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking past, it seems like the room beyond is full to the ceiling of this creature. Within it, you can the lantern light reveals what quick glimpses have failed to reveal. Bones, free floating. The front half of a horse, or at least its half dissolved remains. And perhaps the most concerning, the body of a man in a bathrobe, staring eyelessly out at the group.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The creature immediately pours in, and as it hits the salt on the ground, a violent hissing and bubbling forces the lower half back. The upper half hasn't gotten the memo yet, towering over the women
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The towering ooze gibbers, mouths opening and closing to spew nonsensicle phrases that almost hurt the ears, all in the voices of children. Its black bulbous eyes dot its surface.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen stares up at the creature, looking through it at the body of the man within. She's reminded of when she was grabbed in the attic, the thing holding her face, wrapping around her, smothering her, and she screams. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The salt on the ground is still smoking from where the ooze made contact
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It definitely looks like his picture from the newspaper, if you squint and imagine his skin was still there
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen heaves the whole bag of salt toward the door and into the creature. It splashes into it with a disturbing splat sound, and the explosion of smoke and fumes are accompanied by a screeching cry of children in distress. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen, in the aftermath, is left off balance
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Lillian Lovell
</p>
<p class="gmtext">As Lillian grabs Carmen, the detective violently flails at her, and it's a narrow miss that she doesn't clobber Lillian in the head
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Fortunately for her new friend, Lillian isn't about to leave her friend behind. With a second grab, she pulls the other woman back and away from the incoming wave of slime, the hissing and tumultous screams echoing through the small room.

</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] CREATURE, Main Body 1
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The giant ooze hisses and pops as the salt sinks into its mass, and for a second it gets pulled in. The wave crashes down, striking the salt all across the floor beneath the foliage and joining in with the cacaphony. Fortunately, the group is far enough away to not be splashed upon. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">With a sickening GLORP, the creature hucks out the bag of salt, launching the smoking bag towards Carmen, Lillian, and the Professor!
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The salt bag goes wizzing right past the indoor trio. Fortunately, being within the ooze had softened it down some, making the impact less damaging. Unfortuantely, it had increased its ellasticity. They hear a thud, another thud, and a wetter thud that coincides with a distressed &#34;Honk!&#34; from outside, as the bag hits the ground, bounces up the stairs, and strikes Carl in the back.

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian does the bulk of the work getting Carmen up the stairs. White smoke drifts up and out of the open basement hatch as Carmen finally calms down. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">After a good thirty seconds, it becomes clear that the ooze is not following the group up through the salt-encrusted room
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Stepping down the stairs a bit, the door has closed again. The floor in front of it seems to have a shinier sheen than usual, the salt no longer clearly visible along the floor. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group re-enters the house on the first floor. It's silent, dank, and musky, and it feels a bit more unsettling now compared to the earlier visit. They waste no time in making it up the stairs, and down the hall to the secret passageway. Opening it up, Carmen clambers through while Lillian holds the passageway over. A moment later, she exits with the axe in hand
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group Scooby Doos their way back down the stairs, slipping out as quickly as they entered. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The salt line remains intact
</p>
<p class="gmtext">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yes on the far side
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group sets down the ball, the axe, and the doll on the far side of a line of salt. Carl heads over toward the door, grabbing the handle and yanking it open with force. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">On the far side, again, is a giant wall of slime But this time, half a dozen tendrals burst out of it, lashing out toward the gathered individuals, each person now on the receiving end of gross, slimey pseudopods.

</p>
<h3>Session Date: 2025-06-07</h3>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen hoists the basement door open, her shoes skidding on the trampled vines and growth beneath her. On the far side of the door is an uncomfortably familiar giant wall of slime. Half a dozen tendrals burst out of it, lashing out toward the gathered individuals, and each of our previously pristine heroes is now on the receiving end of gross, slimey pseudopods. One wraps around Carl's arm, another around Carmen's waist, a third around Lillain's leg and two of them around the Professor, one around his neck and the other around his shoulder.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carmen Santamonica
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The salted hand grabs the tendral, and an acrid cloud of smoke billows forth, almost into her face. She holds her breath as the tendral lets go, pulling itself free and retreating
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Lillian Lovell
</p>
<p class="gmtext">One of the mouths on the slime slowly moves up the tendral, closer toward Lillian's leg, yawning open
</p>
<p class="gmtext">With a single swing, Lillian slices through the tendral effortlessly. It clearly severs it, and the part around her leg begins to ooze down her leg as it looses cohesion. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Aya backs up, building space between herself and the door as she gets closer to the stairs. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carl Handy
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The creature's tendral hissse as more salt makes contact with the tendral. It burns through, and as its split apart the remainder schlucks its way back into the main mass and leaves Carl with a goopy mess on his bicep. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Professor Plato
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The bulk of the salt gets on the one around his neck, and that one is severed clean through. The remainder falls on the lower tendral, and it recoils and lets go, pulling back into the main mass. Mouths along the surface cry out like a child whose hand touched hot iron. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Ooze
</p>
<p class="gmtext">With the group backed up to the far side of the room, the creature wiggles and jostles on the far side of the door. More tendrals emerge, testing the ground in front of it, and sizzling as it encounters more salt. It takes hold of the door and pulls it shut again, slamming it closed. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It does not respond to the question overtly, and the group can only hear a muffled whining in the aftermath through the door. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group gathers at the top of the stairs, hypothesizing about the nature of the ghosts and slime monster
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Heading back to town with Lillian in not-the-drivers'-seat, the group rolls back in a little before sunset proper. Unfortunately, the sheriff's office is closed still.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">At the church, the group is met by a very stern looking pastor's wife. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group is allowed back inside, along with the boxes they have. It's not a comfortable place, but they're given a couple of candles before Mrs Haggarty retires for the evening. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">De Occulta Philosophia was found in the trophy room; The Antiquities of Mexico and the Secret Teachings were both in the library (slightly water damaged, iirc). The Golden Bough was found discarded under the professor's bed. The Missing People was found open on his desk. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The professor reads through the Missing People. It's written by a Thomas Pratt about 10 years ago. It's mostly telling of second-hand or third-hand tales of the forest, nothing direct. However, one of the sketches of a figure, supposedly a statue, really sinks into the academic. A sketch of a stone carving with goat legs, a figure with a large round belly and whose head is covered in open mouths that are not unlike the mouths appearing in the ooze. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Secret Teachings is a comprehensive historical survey of folk traditions and magical practices, from antiquity to the modern era. The author traces the evolution of Hermeticism, alchemy, astrology, and other occult &#34;sciences&#34;, though Carmen's only halfway through the Egyptian chapter when her concentration finally breaks and her progress slows
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The Golden Bough meticulously documents the prevalence of ancient cults of life across diverse cultures, focusing on rituals involving harvest festivals, animal fecundity, and the cyclical renewal of life. It seems focused more in Greece than in the new world, but Carl finds himself reading the same page over and over again as he struggles with his fatigue at the end of the day, here.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Dawn rises, and it's at dawn that Mrs Haggarty is pushing the four of you to wake up and get moving before mass starts.

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The truck will only fit two people up front
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen and Carl drive their ways down, making their way back to the manse. Like before, it sits forboding, the overgrowth out front making things around the lower levels hard to make out. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Checking the basement, the group find that the doll, ball, and axe are still down there. However, it seems that the place has been flooded at some point in the night, with a lot of the salt having been washed to the edges of the room. It smells even muskier than normal. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl heads upstairs, the salty hood over his head shielding him from any slimey assault. He unloads the ball, doll, and axe out in the back yard. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl backs the truck up to the porch, and the group begin gathering up bags of salt. They bring it to the hall, slowly piling up the salt on the floor. One bag. Two bags. Three bags. Four bags. Five bags. Six bags. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">A bit out of breath, the sheriff jogs up to the porch. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen deposits another load of salt onto the floor, and there's a notable cracking sound. The floor splits, part of the floor dropping away. Both Carmen and the Sheriff pull back, letting out a cry of alarm. The Sheriff lets out another cry, much more panicked as he sees the writhing tentacles and the creature below. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The creature explodes into billowing smoke, screams of children eminating from the basement. It writhes, it's tentacles trying to reach up and out. You can hear the door in the basement slam open, followed by more screams from over on that side as it immediately finds a freshly salted room. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">With five people loading salt from the truck into the hole, the group continues to fill the house with noxious fumes. The going slows down as the house fills up, with the Sheriff opening up the back door and study window to try and let some out. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The kitchen door bursts open as well, and further screaming can be heard as it runs into the heaps of salt left behind the other day. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Slowly, the screaming dies down, until the house is left, silent as a ghost. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking down the hole,the Professor can see what appears to be a human body, partially submerged in salt. It's hard to see more through the gas, though he thinks he can pick out a horse skull. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The Sheriff is in no mental position to be stopping anybody from doing anything
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Heading down the stairs, the group needs to put clothes over their faces as a filter. The room is dry, now. A shiny sheen covers much of it, but even that isn't as shiny anymore with the salty powder covering it. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian is the only one to spot it. Over in the edge of the room, up against the wall, is a small shape. There's only about a glass worth of liquid left, pressed up against the wall and oozing into it, but in its center is a small black statue. The ooze can't seem to fit it into the wall, and seems to be oozing into and out of the crack as it tries and fails to pull the little fetish into the wall. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl gets a mason jar from the kitchen, bringing it back down and calling Carmen to take a look. Meanwhile, Lillian pours salt onto the thing. With one final scream, the last of the ooze evaporates into a poof of smoke, leaving just the dark figure. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">From there, it's pretty straight forward to scoop up the little idol and plenty of salt, packed full
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking through the salt, the group does find several sets of bones. Judging just from the skulls, there were four people consumed. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Also a horse
</p>
<h3>Session Date: 2025-06-14</h3>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen finishes tightening the mason jar full of salt, the head of the horrible little statue poking up out of it. Only one eye's visible in the salt, but a little shake makes sure that neither are visible as the salt redistributes. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The basement is a mess, with salt and marks of the ooze splatterend all over the walls. You can see straight up from the basement to the second story balcony through the hole in the floor. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It's curently late morning, though despite the sun being up high, the basement is still steeped in shadows. The flashlights and lamps serve to illuminate the scene, though kerchiefs are needed to cover mouths in the powder that's left floating in the air like a haze.

<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carmen Santamonica
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking around the basement, it's full of oddly crushed bales of old magazines, rusty tools, formerly valuable pieces of antinque furniture, and a LOT of leftover salt. It seems that the amount of salt used down here was perhaps more than needed. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The whole house just *feels* better to most of you. Carl and Lillian especially feel like a weight they hadn't even noticed has been lifted off their shoulders, a filter that was over their eyes now lifted to leave things clear. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">(To add to the things in the house, there are also the bones of several bodies; people, a horse, and smaller bones from smaller creatures. Most are bleached white, but the more recent ones are only partially dissolved)

</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl tries to focus his spirit upon the ghosts, breathing deep (until the mold and mildew makes him cough). Unfortunately, he doesn't get any vibes from them this time. It dawns on him that he may need to do some research. Maybe the incomplete copy of Plato's Liber Ivonis has something, or the journal that Carmen took from the house?

<p class="gmtext">A quick glance around the house shows that there's definitely still water damaged. Similarly, a quick inspection shows the sinks work again, though it's hard to tell if it's clean water given how bad the place smells. There are no horse-sized holes, other than maybe the doors.
</p>

</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl heads back upstairs to get his sledgehammer from the attic. He spends some time up there looking through stuff, avoids falling into the trap door (dang), and generally doesn't find anything of note other than the exploded suitcase. It's very cluttered up there with stuff, but even that stuff's been water damaged. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen does find a safe in the trophy room that she can try to break into, but when checking out the bedroom she also finds that there's a shotgun wedged in the fireplace a fair ways up, where the tube narrows.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It's like a solid 10ft up the chimney
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen uses one of the firepoles, longer than usual, and dislodges the shotgun with ease. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The weapon seems fully functional. Checking it out, there are bullets in there, and a close inspection reveals that those bullets had their lead pellets replaced with salt. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The safe itself is built into the wall, so it won't be possible to drag it out. Potentially, the Dodge Brothers have a key for it, or know the code. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Alas, the lock is beyond her. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl pokes around at the wood chips. They seem to have at one point been for the garden, the sort you see padding the floor around bushes or the like. But by this point, the plants growing out of them have really dug their roots in, making it more of a solid mass. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Heading back to town, the group stashes the stuff from the trophy room in the back of the car. They head on back towards the town, Lillian enjoying the breeze in the back. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Luckily, while there are people socializing over at the church, the group doesn't spot any of the Dodge brothers over there. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The sheriff engages in a bit of small talk, but Lillian has a way to smoothing things over. Additionally, she breaks the news to him about finding what is probably Curwen's body, which seems to be an unexpected relief for the law enforcement officer. By the end of it, the group leaves a letter behind for the Dodge Brothers with their contact info, and the sheriff agrees to pass it on. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Just to clarify you are: 1) not telling them about the Trophy Room (which Lillian remembered to lock), 2) found the books, 3) found Arthur dead, 4)  the Dodge brothers should do a cleanup of the basement, 5) not actually telling them about the hole (but they do say &#34;watch your step&#34;), 6) law enforcement is involved, and 7) substantial damage to the house
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian checks in at the litlte church, where the Father greets her. His wife, busy entertaining guests, is thankfully not around. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group heads out on the road, illicit gains in the trunk alongside licit ganes.

<p class="gmtext">[TURN] Carmen Santamonica
</p>
<p class="gmtext">As things wrap up, the group receives their payments from the Dodge Brothers. There doesn't appear to be a deduction for the large number of indiginous artefacts that the group took with them,so they may have gotten away with something there. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen in particuilar does well, having received direct mention in a news reporting about how she had a hand in discovering the long-lost murderer Arthur Curwen.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen doubles down on her business, taking in more jobs and working longer hours. She is able to capitalize on her temporary fame, though not as much as she might've wished. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Does anybody else want to research the Liber Ivonis with Carmen? (This will not give bonus rolls, this merely means you both go through the experience together &#60;3)
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">There are several aspects to the journals that Carmen can seek out more information on: his desmesne, his immortality, his dagger, and the rats
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian takes the time to see a professional, a Doctor Shirley Barnett. The doctor gives her a series of tasks to do throughout the week, things like mandatory time visiting one of a list of places which the Doctor says have &#34;strong psychoinfluential values&#34;. The entertainer is even encouraged to take her girlfriend with her. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">These places tend to be places with a strong natural tendency to them or with strong human connection. Going out to a lighthouse one weekend, and the next going to a street fair. Through this, Lillian's girlfriend Yvonne accompanies her for many of them, and even adds a few places herself. The pair wind up talking a lot about fortune telling, and about the stories that run parallel to such supernatural tellings, bolstering Lillian's knowledge of the occult. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The professor volunteers for a position on staff at the University where he helps organize, attend, and speak at various scientific conferences. It works fairly well getting in the door, but he does not strike it rich
</p>
<p class="gmtext">More seriously, he obtains the fetish from Illy. He brings it into his home, setting the fetish out on the table, and waits. He creates a &#34;salt box&#34;, and sets the fetish in it (wearing gloves to avoid touching it directly). He sets it in, and it sits there. In the box. Seconds pass, then minutes.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The professor watches it for tens of minutes, then hours, taking notes and keeping an eye on the thing. Eventually, he notices steam emitting from it, and a closer look reveals that the surface is slick now, though the base of it has sunk into the salt box as the salt reacts to the moisture. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The statue is definitely slowly dissolving its way through the bottom of the salt box
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Slowly, it melts through the salt box, with the slime eating away a small hole. As more of the salt beneath it vanishes, it's able to pool into a small puddle, and continues to ooze. By this point, dusk has fallen, and the professor's eyes are heavy with exhaustion. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The professor pours in a bunch of salt, and there's a pop and crackle as the salt cancels out all the slime. He boxes it back up for the night, and continues his research like this. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Over the course of weeks and months, he's able to ascertain a few things. First, the salt in the mason jar seems to prevent it from even generate slime. Second, it's very consistent in how much of the slime it creates at a time. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Pouring in a slurry of food, the creature does seem to absorb and begin to consume it. However, the professor is not willing to let it grow overnight, limiting his growth in knowledge to just the fact that it will slowly consume things like sugar, meat, and food slurries. It grows a little faster with the food, but not a lot. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">He does not get any signs of conscious recognition. It seems to respond very predictably, and does not respond to non-food and non-salt stimuli other than to slowly try to climb it. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It does not form any mouths nor eyes, instead remaining a semi-transparent liquid.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato obtains several jars of the goop from the slime. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Pouring the slime on the meat, it doesn't seem to do anything. Even after a few hours, it hasn't really dissolved it. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Unless placed on salt, it seems to be chemically innert. With the salt, it still bubbles and boils away
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It's toward the tail end of his experiments that he begins plant experiments, growing several tomato plants and giving them different amounts of the slime as fertilizer. It's a STAGGERING difference, with the slime seeming to increase the growth dramatically and giving large, ripe, delicious looking tomatos. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Tomatos typically develop their fruit over the course of 60-90 days. The well gooped tomatos are making fruit after only 2-3 weeks, and they're really good looking. Very healthy plants. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking into the immortality, Carmen slowly works out the details for *how*. It requires cross referencing and details, decoding parts of seemingly-nonsensical phrases, she obtains a phrase which can be said with power. This is what Corbitt used as a basis for his immortality, drawing out the fortune from other individuals and converting it into fortitude. With this spell, Carmen is confident that she could draw out the life forces of someone else and replenish her *own* fortune.

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian throws her little dart toward the dartboard. It comes close to the center,  despite the dart being absolutely horrible quality, and Yvonne is among the masked crowd cheering for the success. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The staff had been handing out small domino masks of various styles for the attendees in the little Halloween Festival, with several different attractions to draw people in. There was a blend of activities to do, crafts to make, and stories being told. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">This one in particular offered small prizes, little trinkets or charms. Given that darts were so similar to knives, it was expected that Lillian would do well, much to the enjoyment of her girlfriend. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Despite the masks, it was hard to not recognize Aurelia. She was in a more modern version of a Romanian dress, and her hair fell back in waves over her head. Lush and full, unlike when she had it tied back during her routines. She accepts the next dart, lines up the toss, and throws it. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian Lovell (Romanian): FINE one more dart
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian Lovell (Romanian): One more round love. If I lose not only will I tell you you were right again but I'll let you pick what we do the rest of the night
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian Lovell (Romanian): I'll admit I'm second rate when Yvonne says I'm second rate. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian Lovell (English): It'll be ok love
</p>
<p class="gmtext">(If you get a Success on your Throw, then you land it in the ring outside the bullseye. A Hard success or better will land it in the bullseye)
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The first throw from Lillian wipes the smile off Aurelia's face, landing right on the edge of the Bulls Eye. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian Lovell (romanian): hmph
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian's second dart doesn't come as close as Aurelia's did, but that does land two of her darts in the center to Aurelia's one. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian Lovell (English): that last one was really bad
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian Lovell (English): Don't let all the blood flow to your head the next time you're up on the ropes Aurelia 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">As quickly as she appeared, the slim woman vanishes back into the crowds, heading off deeper into the festival
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian Lovell (English): I wish I could say I need a drink but that may be unwise 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Lillian Lovell (English): That sounds lovely
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You can add &#34;Festival Trinket&#34; to your Treasured Possessions, if you think this qualifies :3

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The heavy rain outside really just adds to the atmosphere of the little house. Fortunately, Carl and the trio he'd brought with him had managed to get the flooring out of the truck before the downpour started. Not the tools, but Old Man McGregor told'm that he could just use his old tools and such in the basement. He had a crowbar for sure, and probably a few more things down there. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The three who he'd brought with him were Kazie, Roscoe, and Thomas. Kazie was a black girl in overalls and thick gloves, more than willing to get in it with the rest of the lot. Roscoe was a scrawny lad with bottle glasses. Thomas was the youngest of the bunch, maybe only 14, but was bigger than most kids his size and had the telling shock of red hair. 
</p>

</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The basement space is cluttered, with cobwebs all over.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group of Betty, Lucille, and Roscoe head down with Carl into the basement to sort it out and pull the tools up and out. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group makes it down the creaky old stairs, and begins parsing through the things. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">All three pause and turn to look at him.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It takes a bit of sorting, but overall only about 15-20min for the group to pick out the tools and the like. Heading back upstairs, they're able to get a start on pulling up the old floorboards and putting in the new ones they'd hoisted into the entryway.

<h3>Session Date: 2025-07-26</h3>
<p class="gmtext">The small property in Downtown Boston was decorated with pumpkins on its porch. The door was left wide open, though its occupants were wearing longer sleeves rolled up in the brisk 55F weather. The November sun shown down, warming the day more than usual, and warming all sorts of old furniture, boxes, and various bits of garbage from the house's basement. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Inside, a man and several youths were in the process of pulling out even more stuff from the basement; a young black girl helped Carl steady a table as he did the majority of the lifting to get it up the narrow stairs.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">It's at this point, halfway up the stairs, that Carl and young Kazie heard a tremendous crash from the basement area, where Thomas and Lucille had been left to free up a large wardrobe. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Pulling back, Kazie helps Carl get the giant table up the stairs, onto the blanket, and helps drag it over to the doorway. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">As Carl heads down to take a look at it himself, he's greeted by the sight of the wardrobe. It's sitting tilted, and one of the kids has opened it up to reveal a tumble of identical wooden dolls
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Spot Hidden Check
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">The job is to clear out the house. It was owned by an old pack rat, so you were tasked by an Anthony George, the man's brother, in cleaning out the house. You've gotten the main floor done, and are working on the basement now. 
</p></div></div>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">If it goes well, the man wanted to hire you for some of the remodeling as well
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Carl's eyes are drawn away from the multitude of little dolls, and to the wall. The wardrobe had collapsed into the wall, and the corner had not only gotten stuck in it, but appears to have knocked a brick into the wall, resulting in a partial hole.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Somewhere, across the city, a few remaining stolen pieces of South American history sit inside a vault in a detective's office. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Scooting the wardrobe out of the way (and kicking a few dolls aside), Carl peeks into the hole. It looks like there's not just a room, but a hallway, leading into the darkness beyond where the flashlight will reach. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking over the brickwork, he can tell that it's really shoddy craftsmanship. Whoever put this thing together didn't really know what he was doing, and it's not surprising that the brick wall came apart so easily. Honestly, given that the house is from the 1700s, it's surprising it hasn't happened sooner. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">A few more bricks slip free, widening the hole even further. The brickwork shudders.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">All three of the teens pull back a bit. There's a wider hole, maybe 2ft across, and the brickwork definitely does not seem stable now. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The wall is definitely not load bearing. Looking at it better now, it looks like it was actually installed after the house was put together. Carl's pretty confident he can just use a broom to knock the bricks free and loose until the unstable portion is taken care of, and can then use the orphaned children to clean up the mess. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group's eager to watch him go to work, cheering him on as he knocks it free. In the end, he widens out a tunnel that's maybe 7-8 feet wide and 6-7 feet tall.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The dolls were simple wooden dolls dressed up in Civil War attire; all in little Union jackets. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The tunnel is a narrow one, 6-7ft wide, and almost short enough that Carl feels the need to stoop. Almost. The light stretches down the corridor, lighting up regular support frames in the walls and ceiling. It's angled down a bit on a slope as you descend. After a couple minutes, the light from your flashlight shines upon another tunnel, running almost perpendicular.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Mr George is not actually local, so he's leaving this up to you. He'll make the trip out to inspect it, but he's not going to stop by without notice. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">None of them want to be reminded of the work they have to do. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Children chased away, Carl's left alone in the house. It's pretty easy to pass on a message, though, and so Carmen, Lillian, and the Professor wind up getting messages from an orphan each.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Kazie is a black girl, dressed in jeans and a shirt with a little flatcap on. Lucille is in a shirt and ankle-length skirt, with her hair tied back into a ponytail. Thomas is a blond boy with big glasses, but otherwise pretty scrawny. They're all in their mid-teens (think high-schoolers)
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Go ahead and mark your Throw for improvement, and let me know at the end to roll a Throw improvement for Kazie
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Carmen shows up first, followed by the Professor (who had to go to Carl's business to get directions first). Last is Lillian, who spent a fair bit of time showing an orphaned girl how to throw daggers before having to also ask for directions at where Carl currently is. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">So our investigators line up in front of the hole in the basement, leading into a dark and cramped space. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">As a reminder for research: Main areas of info-gathering include the Library (older or specialized texts), Newspaper Archives (either at the library or at the newspaper for the Boston Globe, biggest newspaper in the city), Town Hall (for permits, deeds, birth certificates, etc), and Police Station (for criminal records, morgue information, and similar things)
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The professor looks into the histoiry for mining in the area, but finds nothing with regards to that. Mining in Boston has never been a thing, so whatever purpose the tunnels serve, they merely borrowed the design. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">For the house, the professor uncovers the record of deed transfer and construction date of it. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Given the lack of mine details or any sort of registry, it's reasonable to conclude that this is some sort of smuggling tunnel. It's possible that it originated during the civil war, or came from some time closer to the revolutionary war.
</p>

<p class="gmtext">ERRATA: It's Anthony's sister who was the packrat, not his brother
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Only the ones for the initial construction. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The tunnel sits before the group, the four investigators whispering to one another in front of it. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">(22 after)
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The group heads into the tunnel, walking down the slight incline to the next set of tunnels. Their footsteps echo through the chambers as their lanterns flicker, stale air around them. Easy mapping so far, because it is a straight tunnel. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">They come to the branch, though, a second tunnel which runs perpendicular to this one
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You walked south down the original path, which has hit a T-intersection from there. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Heading west along the tunnel, after walking about 200 feet, you come across ancient remains of several people. There are tattered clothes and the remains of iron manacles around the limbs of at least three of them. Many bones have become separated, so they're no longer clearly six. Ten feet past them, on the south wall, is another opening.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Looking over the bodies, it's clear that the rotting clothing is from outfits in the revolutionary era
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The outfits of the manacled individuals are significantly worse quality; given the context, it's likely that these were slaves and people escorting slaves. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">I'll need that Forensics roll to see if you can tell what direction they were traveling
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Slavery was outlawed in Massachusetts in the 1780s, and there were some underground slave operations in that general timeframe. This may be an undiscovered section of that sort of route. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">There are two paths that remain open, after stepping past the tangle of remains. One heads south, and the other continues to the west. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Professor Plato can ascertain that they were likely travelling east, the way you were coming from. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The lanternlight doesn't reveal anything important about the south hall as you pass it. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">You continue down into the dark cooridor, travelling further west, the walls pressing in on all sides. It narrows in some parts, but for most of it you can walk upright and side-by-side. The walk is mostly straight, and you continue for about 15min before ending in an old brick wall.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">This wall is a similarly shoddy job to the other one. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Carl checks the different bricks and eventually finds one that's loosest. He knocks it free, and it reveals a dusty basement full of boxes and some old furniture and tools. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">DOLL IN THE WALL
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The group returns back to the intersection, and this time the southern path is to the right. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The tunnel leads south for about a minute before you come to a sudden intersection. A set of stairs are roughly hewn into the tunnel to access another one. This new tunnel is more of a natural cave, narrow but tall.&#13;&#13;This one leads east and west, though the ends both seem to curve south. The east end slopes upward and the west end slopes downward.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">Following along this path for a few hundred feet, the tunnel ends. The end of the wall is flat, with a geometric pattern of semicircles and lines carved into it.
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Make some Spot Hidden checks 
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Carl and Lillian both notice that the natural cave here isn't just a single crevice that you're traveling along. Other, smaller tunnels branch off periodically in both directions, some large enough for you to crawl into, but most much too small. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Y'all can freely move your characters now
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The carving seems old, not anything recent. But it seems like it was well done work, the carving is very smooth in the stone, to the point where the face of the stone and the portion carved are polished and cleanly made. Likewise, the circles are remarkably uniform.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">While it kind of looks like a door, there's no seam in the stone. It's just smooth, contiguous stone. 
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">lick it
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The group backtracks, heading along to the area they were at before, and beyond into the deeper tunnels to the east. 
</p>
<p class="gmtext">This passageway leads to a downward sloping passage. The corridor twists and turns, and after about 10min the investigators come around a bend to see a steady, dim light. The passage straightens out, and the light ahead grows brighter, though the light source remains unknown. Soon, the passage opens into an enormous chamber lit by phosphorescent lichen.
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">Option 1) We can make it so you went left instead of right, to travel the up direction first and then the down direction after. Or Option 2) the left side of the map is the one that lead up, and the right side is the one that leads down. 
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">The cave is filled with an eerie, ambient light emitted by a sort of lichen. It coats most of the walls, the natural rock columns, and the ceiling. It's not bright, perhaps only lending the equivalent to candlelight, but it means there's little risk of missing a step in the dim blue-green lights. Down the center, there's a pathway where the floor is smooth, but to either side the ground is uneven.
</p>
<div class="row"><div class="image"><p><img src="../Assets/Images/PlaceHolder.png"></p></div><div class="name"><p><strong>GM</strong></p></div><div><p class="gmplayer">The cave is huge, maybe 30-40ft high, 60ft wide, and 100ft long (though not really a cube shape)
</p></div></div>
<p class="gmtext">Beneath the lichen, the walls and rocky columns have been decorated with intricate carvings. The lichen along the walls is of various colors, and seems to paint the carvings. Serpent motifs predominate, some of which are enormous, and are acompanied by abstract and geometric designs like zigzags and spirals. The works continue hundreds of feet up to the ceiling, but even a quick examinations shows that they've been badly damaged. Around 50ft of the eastern wall has outright collapsed, obliterating any carvings or passage once there.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">To the far side of this cavern, it narrows down and continues into the distance.
</p>
<p class="gmtext">The group is pulled from their reverie at investigating the cavern walls and pillars by a squishing sound behind them. Turning around, they cast their lights, but they only catch a faint hint of movement behind the pillars. Something -- several somethings by the sounds of it -- moving around the far outer periphery of the cave.
