<font color="#261A12">Saturday morning is a relaxed and calm day for most, but not for all. This morning, three individuals sit at a table for four, waiting for their host to arrive. Each has received a letter, a commission, to look into the affairs of a Mr Steven Knott</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: (If you hit the Notes tab of your character sheet, there's a small blurb for your character. Feel free to modify it as you like)</font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; GM: The Professor Is typing fine or do you want me on audio for explaining how the game works? (I know you dont like reading through FF stuff a lot so I want to make sure this isn't the same)</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carl Handy: Can the other people see my character sheet?  And vice versa</font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; Carl Handy: Nope</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Carmen Santamonica): Does this still work? o.o</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: If you hold &#34;Alt&#34; when you hit enter, you'll do OOC chat</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Carmen Santamonica): Oh yeah! you can also use /ooc at the start of your message! :D</font><br />
<font color="#880000">GM: notes that if you hold Control+Shift, you'll emote</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: oh heck, control+shift is &#34;action text&#34;, control I think is just emote</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carl Handy: idly twirls a screwdriver.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">Mogstew (Carl Handy): I presume OOC means out of character</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica: sits back in her chair with her arms folded, casually eyeing the other two guests from under her hat</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: So, uh.  Either of you two know this Steven Knott fella?  I'm Carl, by the way.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Pleasure to meet you, Carl. My name is Carmen. Don't know the man personally, only through a family friend.</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Breakfast arrives to the three individuals at the table just as another man walks in. He's small and in his 50s with heavy eyebrows. The cane he's brought thunks on the ground as he makes his way over, leaning on it rather heavily. </font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: Ah, great, only three people responded. </font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: Well, which ones are you?</font><br />

<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica sits up, and removes her hat as food is placed at the table. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Good morning. You must be Mr. Knott. I'm Carmen Santamonica.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: The detective you sent for.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Hi I'm Carl.  Carl Handy.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: Ah yeah, nice to meet you. Merriweather recommended you.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carl Handy: extends a rough hand for a handshake.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Mr Knott turns to Carl, giving him an appraising look</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Mr Knott reaches out to shake the hand. Not as frail a handshake as expected.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: Ah, and you'll be the Professor, then</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: So, I've brought the lot of you here because I have a task for you. I picked up his house through my sister-in-law, but it's in awful condition. </font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: I tried hiring out to get it fixed up, but none of the workers want anything to do with it because of these STUPID rumors. So I want you three to look into it. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Uh, I don't mean to pry Mr Knott but I'm not much for social circles.  What rumors?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica pulls a notepad and pen from her jacket and starts to jot down notes</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: A bunch of superstitious nonsense. My wife's cousin had a mental break a few years ago and everyone's attributing it to some dumb curse. We're in Boston, not Egypt! </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica stops short of what she was writing before looking up,</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: A curse?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: Which is why I want you there as well, Professor Plato. You're a history guy, if you say the house hasn't had any Indian burial grounds on it then maybe people will forget about this</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: It's nothing specific, they just attribute all the bad stuff with curses in general. I fell down the stairs when trying to fix the railing and they called it the curse. </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Mr Knott gestures down at his leg with his cane</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: I figure you'd probably have the know-how to figure out more recent history with it, Ms Santamonica</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Hm. Specifics would help with debunking whatever's going on. Might need to ask around.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carl Handy: Looks about trying to spot the broken railing.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: Anyways, I've got $25 for each of you upfront. $20 more if you're done before 9am Monday, I want to get this thing moving</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: Oh, and here</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Mr Knott holds out an envelope with with &#34;20 Sheafe&#34; written on it and contains two keys</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: Address and keys, one for the front and one for the back</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: I need those back, I don't have any spares yet</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica reaches out for the envelope.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: If you want to find out more about the rumors, I'd recommend either checking out the incident a few years back in the library's newspaper archive or just asking around nearby.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Star, how's your library use skill?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carl Handy: [SKILL] Library Use (20%) [Fail] (Spend 10 of your 60 luck to succeed.)</font> [d100 = 30]<br />
<font color="#005500">Mogstew (Carl Handy): sorry!</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Professor Plato): 75</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Way better than mine or Carl's xD</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Those are good places to start. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: If you three have questions, you can ask Mr Knott now as he eats breakfast. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: But yeah, talk to each other with plans. Where do you want to go? What do you want to know? I can provide guidance of where you might go to find stuff</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: You said your sister-in-law passed you this house? </font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: Yup, her cousins aren't in a position to care for it, so I grabbed it</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Your wife's cousin, had a mental breakdown while staying? Any specifics on that event that you could share? Anyone notice strange activity before the breakdown? </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Mr Dooley considers as he chews on his bagel</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Mr Knott considers as he chews on his bagel</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: I mean, nothing that's been mentioned to me. Both Gabriela and Vittorio are over in the Roxbury Sanitarium now, though. Their kids are down in Baltimore, I think. Staying with family</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: Ah but leave the kids out of this. My wife would kill me, the whole thing is incredibly upsetting to them</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Are Gabriela and Vittorio well enough to receive visitors?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: Depends, you'd have to go ask how they're doing. I've been trying to focus on the damn house. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Understandably, sir. Anything more you can share about the house? Age, size, number of rooms...?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: Oh I have no idea on the age, it's pretty old though. Oldest on the street, I think. Four rooms on the first floor, four on the second, plus the bathroom. Small basement.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Attic or crawl space?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: It's hooked up to the grid now, so it does have power, and I got the plumbing working last week</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: Not much of an attic, but there's some space up there</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: No crawl space, just the basement</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: I don't know about curses or ancient history, but your family has my condolences.  Poor kids, a family falling apart like that...I'll do my best to give you an honest appraisal of the state of the house.  Besides the railing you mentioned are there any areas of particular concern?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: Basement stars are hell</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: *stairs</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carl Handy: the starting premise for me is that I'm supposed to fix up what I can in the house, not just list what is wrong with the place?</font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; GM: He'd appreciate it, but he's not expecting you to fix everything. Just to give him paperwork so he can say the house is structurally sound and isn't a danger to people.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Got any spare pictures of the place?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: The basement is full of clones of Star</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Knott: Nah, the photographer never answered my letter. Probably busy. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: &#34;Deeper than I feared&#34; is a pretty common theme lol</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Did poloroids exist in the 20s?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Yes</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Well, photos like those did, they weren't disposable though</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Oh it looks like they still require a dark room to develop the footage</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Nope you can just ask</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I think that's part of the investigation! :D</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: It seems that Knott is under the impression it could just be anything, but you can check out what happened to his sister-in-law for more details. Either the old news papers in the Library or going directly to the source at the Sanitarium. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: *to his cousin, pardon me</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: You'd roll a d100 and try to roll under 20</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Hawu, you have a 40 in Intimidate</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: You also have a 55 in Fighting (Brawl)</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Library is a good starting spot :3</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: (POLL) Library?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Correct!</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Either or, you can always lie about the quality of the house</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Yeah you have the address so you can go there, but you haven't been there before</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: You're all in a restaurant</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Oh no I didn't actually state it was a restaurant &#60;u&#62;</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): &#60;3</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">If you want to Help someone with a roll, they can gain a Bonus Die by hitting the +1B button before rolling</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: So gentlemen. I think a good place to start is the library news archives. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: So Carl can help out with research if he wants</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: (POLL) Do you want to go to the Library?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Our intrepid investigators bid farewell to Mr Knott and head over toward the Boston Library. Fortunately, these Librarians are not the ones from Nightvale, and are able to point our heroes over toward the Newspaper Archives. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Mr Professor, I believe you're probably best qualified to start this route. Carl, if you'd be a dear and help the good Professor, I'll ask the staff if there's anything they can share.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: For every 6 hours spent researching, each player can make a Library Use roll to sift through and find details on the house. If you're looking for something specific, let me know and you may get a Bonus Die to narrow it down. It's about 10am when you arrive. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Flawless </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: What're you looking for, Professor?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Roll a Library Use roll, then! </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Yup</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Yup</font><br />

<font color="#000000">GM: You don't get to roll yourself</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Carmen can hit the +B button and roll as well, since she's having a librarian help her look through as well. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Roll for it, Professor! </font><br />
<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: [SKILL] Library Use (75%) [Hard success]</font> [d100 = 36]<br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Star has to hit the +1B button</font><br />

<font color="#000000">GM: lmao </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: it is the same</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Perfect!</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Roll for it, Carmen!</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: (you get a +1B too)</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): For talkin with the staff? :o Is that also a Library Use? </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Pretty much. A &#34;turn&#34; for research is 6 hours, so instead of rolling your own die you helped boost the Professor's</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Correct, Illy. The staff is going to help you look into stuff, so you get a +1B too</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: You can, but if you do research for 3 hours you'll get a Penalty die, the opposite of a Bonus die</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Rushing it can be done, though</font><br />

<font color="#000000">GM: Mhm</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">While researching, the professor stumbles across the first article mentioning the house. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">A second article is discovered not too long later by Carl</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: (the headlines are legit headlines from the 20s)</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Yes. If you take the little icon in the top left, you can click and drag them into the bar in the bottom of your UI</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Then you can click'm whenever you want</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Chilprufe underear for men xD</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen discovers some news as well, of a different sort</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">And the final piece which the group discovers is found with the help of one of the librarians. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: 1925</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alas, the article does not specify what those habits are, though clearly they were displeasing to the neighbors. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: That was me</font><br />
<font color="#880000">GM: takes notes on the interface</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Ms Booker: If you want more details on the will, you'd do best to either check the Hall of Records or to try the police station to see if they might have the complaint</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica: So the group reconviens after their hours of searchig to share notes</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Looks like the next best thing to check would be this will. Thank you, Ms. Booker.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: I wonder if the Pastor that filed Mr. Corbitt's will would speak with us about it, and about Mr. Corbitt.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: No those are the same kids that Knott told you about</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): That rampage article is about his wife's cousin yeah</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: This is also used for battlemaps</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Distance</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: How about we check the will next and I'll add the Pastor to the list of potential contacts</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I'd like to know why it was blocked</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: (POLL) Check out the Will at the Hall of Records?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Our amazing investigators make their way over to the Hall of Records. It's around 4:30pm by the time they arrive, giving them ample opportunity to do some research with their remaining daylight hours</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: (Note that while rushing to get this done in 3 hours instead of 6 does give a penalty die, you also get a bonus die for having someone help you. Those would cancel each other out)</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: brb one sec</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): On brb: GM and Professor Plato</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Back!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Professor, Carl, I'd like you two to check on this will while I talk to some locals about what the curse on this house might be. We've got a good lead on the happenings of the hosue but not no mentions of curses yet and I'd like to get something on it before it gets too dark.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Did it go away?</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Carmen Santamonica): Plan here being we can rush the search for the will while also getting some extra information</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: And I gave it back :D</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Still Library Use to check out the Hall of Records</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: You got this \o/</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: You can just not do either, and just roll like normal</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: [SKILL] Library Use (75%) [Regular success]</font> [d100 = 70]<br />
<font color="#261A12">The secretary to the Hall of Records greets the Professor and Mr Handy, letting them into the archive. The pair work together, sifting through wills until they discover one of particular interest. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: oh man I should've written the whole thing in FF font</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: I wonder why they disputed the will o:</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Carmen Santamonica): Gee I hope that we can take a copy of this will too</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Meanwhile, over on Sheafe Street, Carmen arrives at her destination. The little house is overshadowed by taller, newer office buildings on either side. The house fronts the street, with a small porch. On either side, withered plants lead down narrow alleyways to its back yard. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Nope, that's fine</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): You two remember pagers, right?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Out front, there's a single man with a small cigar and newspaper stand who gives a wave. The other buildings seem to be closed for the weekend; a small law firm, a dentist's office, a small bookstore. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Overall, I assume you're copying down the details from the articles you have</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: This is like Carl holding the paper up to the light to try and see what is blocked out</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: That's fine by me</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Carmen Santamonica): Oooh flavor!</font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; Professor Plato: If you angle your head some, it comes out better</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica returns the wave of the man before approaching.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Afternoon, sir. Pleasent weather.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Dooley: Evenin' Miss. I'm Mr Dooley, pleasure to meet you. </font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Dooley: Care for a paper? A cigar?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Carmen. Actually, I'm looking for some information. </font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Dooley: Well, that's what I sell! What can I do ya for? </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: That house there, between the office buildings. What can you tell me about it?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Dooley: What, the old Corbitt place? Pretty dark history, that one</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica retrieves her pen and pad</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Dooley: Italian family moved in there a few years back and went mad. Even the nearby businesses don't do too well in light of that</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Anything you can tell me about the family? Specifically a Mr. Walter Corbitt?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Dooley: Hmm? Yeah, they say it's his ghost haunting the place</font><br />
<font color="#005500">Mogstew (Carl Handy): Carmen can you ask this guy about the Chapel of Contemplation too</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Dooley: I can't quite remember who told me that, though...</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Carmen Santamonica): I haven't found out about them yet Hawu so I wouldn't have that information to ask</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Mr Dooley rubs his chin with one hand, his other hand rubbing thumb and fingers together conspicuously </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica looks up at the man</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: His ghost?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Dooley: Yeah, I just can't quite remember, the details, though</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Dooley: It's on the tip of my tongue, if only something could jog my memory</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You can go for one of your Interpersonal rolls here if you'd like, or you can just pay him some from your $25. </font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Carmen Santamonica): let's try a persuade first</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: (Go for it!)</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: (Which angle do you want to take?)</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: guava juice?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I like Hawu's idea. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Yeah! :D</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Roll Persuade</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Well sir, I've been asked to look into the place. Hopefully help put some of these nasty rumors to rest. Any information you have would be very helpful. </font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carmen Santamonica: [SKILL] Persuade (50%) [Fail] (Spend 32 of your 40 luck to succeed.)</font> [d100 = 82]<br />

<font color="#005500">GM: (More if you do good things, like saving people or killing monsters)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You realize that you could push the roll if you want, pointing out the condition of Mr Dooley's shabby cart. Obviously an improvement of the neighborhood would benefit him. Of course, he might take that the wrong way...</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Sure, I'll push it. </font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carmen Santamonica: [SKILL] Persuade (50%) [Fail]</font> [d100 = 91]<br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Trash rolls :D</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Mr Dooley looks a bit offended</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica retrieves a dollar from her jacket, and places it on the cart</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: An investment.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Mr Dooley slowly pockets the dollar</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Dooley: Well I mean... I suppose I could use a touch-up. It's just that those are just sooo expensive. A dollar won't go nearly far enough, I'd need like at least $10 to make sure that works. </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica raises an eyebrow before flipping her notebook closed. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: We could also be done here. Just looking for some help. </font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Carmen Santamonica): Sorry pal. You're not getting 10 bucks from me xD I was gonna give you 50 cents initially before I botched both rolls</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Mr Dooley: Ain't we all, hun? I'm just tryna run a business here, you know? Provide a service to the community. I understand where you're coming from, though. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: lol no not really</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Usually you just feed on the homeless</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: What?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Money would be more of a factor if we were doing something long term</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">It appears that he's been offended and isn't really willing to give more about the supposed haunting, but you know that someone gave him that idea. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Ugh that really killed my momentum</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The house looms in front of Carmen. Perhaps, if someone can't answer the question for her...</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Yeah, though you'll probably want to check them up in the Hall of Records</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The street appears to be largely businesses now, none open by this point in the evening on a Saturday. Carmen has some time left if she has other leads to follow up on, or she can meet up with her friends. </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica sighs before turning toward the house.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Well, good afternoon Mr. Dooley. Good luck with your business.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Wanna go in? :3</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Alone? Heck no. Just going to circle the outside before maybe heading to the sanitorium</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Circling around the house, it leads to a small, dead back yard with a small dead tree. The windows are dirty and dark, not letting much light nor vision through them at all. A few supplies sit in the back yard, like lumber and a box of nails</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Hall of Records is open until 9pm</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: What're you looking for?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Looking into the Church shouldn't be too tough. With help from Carl and the name, you can make the roll rushed with a bonus die</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Mhm!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Sure is!</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: You get +1P for rushing, +1B for Carl (canceling out), and +1B for having the name and an easier search. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: So you have +1B overall</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: [BON][SKILL] Library Use (75%) [Regular success]</font> [d100+t100 = 72]<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: :D</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Saved by the bonus</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Two things of note come up in the search. One is the address, allowing you three to go check out the premisis. However, more importantly...</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: lmao</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The Hall of Records does close down, which leaves the pair free to go meet up with Carmen, check out the church, or check out the house. But before that, we must follow Carmen's track</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Heading out toward the outskirts, Carmen catches a lift to the Sanitarium. The building is large and sturdy, but it's got plenty of flowers and greenery. The receptionist looks up at her as she enters. </font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dr Flynn: Oh, hello there. How can I help you?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Good evening. Carmen Santamonica. Private detective. I'd like to check to see if a couple of patients are able to recieve visitors?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dr Flynn: Hmm? Hopefully nothing legal to worry about. Who were you looking for?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I was hoping to see either Mr. or Mrs. Macario</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Dr Flynn takes a moment to flick through the records, speaking as he does so</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dr Flynn: And can I ask what this is with regards to?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Sorry, sir. Private investigation. I'd just like to ask some questions</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Dr Flynn looks over his glasses at her, eyebrow raised</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dr Flynn: Our patients are in a precarious state of mind. I'm afraid I'll have to know at least a little about what you're looking for if I'm to judge if this will be good for them. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I was hired to look into the house they were staying at the time before they were admitted. History of the home and things like that.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dr Flynn: Hmmmm</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dr Flynn: I don't think Mr Macario would handle that well, but... Gabriela is more approachable. I'll have to insist on being present while you talk to her, though. Give me one moment. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Understandable. I appreciate it.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">A few minutes later, he leads Carmen back through the wards. It's a pretty peaceful scene, and they wind up near a window overlooking the gardens out back. Sitting in a little chair is Gabriela Macario a bible on her hands. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Mr Knott: Oh I have no idea on the age, it's pretty old though. Oldest on the street, I think. Four rooms on the first floor, four on the second, plus the bathroom. Small basement.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Mr Knott: Oh I have no idea on the age, it's pretty old though. Oldest on the street, I think. Four rooms on the first floor, four on the second, plus the bathroom. Small basement.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Welcome to Fantasy Grounds</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I remember this happening! :D</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Understandable. I appreciate it.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dr Flynn: Gabriela? We have someone to see you here. </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gabriela Macario looks up with wide eyes at Carmen</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: spell emaculit</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Emaculate! </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Wait..</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Good evening Mrs. Marcario. My name is Carmen. Would you be alright with speaking with me for a few minutes?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gabriela Macario: Of course, what can I help you with?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gabriela Macario sounds older than a woman her age should</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: She's a cousin to his wife, yes</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I was asked by Mr. Steven Knott to look into the house you used to live in on Copp's Hill. You know Mr. Knott, correct?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gabriela Macario immediately does the sign of the cross</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gabriela Macario: That house is cursed. The devil resides in it</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica glances back at Dr. Flynn for his reaction before turning back to Gabriela</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Dr Flynn only gives a nod, a pen and paper in hand as he watches the couple. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Yes... I had heard it's being haunted by a previous owner from a local. What makes you think the house is cursed? </font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dr Flynn: I'd wake to see it standing over me. The Devil himself</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dr Flynn: Watching me</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Carmen Santamonica): it's not the doctor saying that you goobers xD</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gabriela Macario: I'd wake to see it standing over me. The Devil himself</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gabriela Macario: Watching me</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gabriela Macario: It hated us</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): GMing has a lot to keep track of!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Oh...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I see, did the other members of your family see the devil as well? </font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gabriela Macario: Vittorio... it hated him</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gabriela Macario: It would spoil his food, fill our bed with rats, whisper to him</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gabriela Macario: Terrible things... terrible things...</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Doug Devildome, owner of the Dimsdale Devildome</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): This is the second FOP reference this session</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): No such thing!</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gabriela Macario: begins to hyperventilate, and Dr Flynn steps up to walk her through a calming exercise. </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gabriela Macario begins to hyperventilate, and Dr Flynn steps up to walk her through a calming exercise. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Thank you Gabriela, I'm sure this is stressful. </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gabriela Macario looks up at Carmen</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gabriela Macario: You can't let it out</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I'll, do my best ma'am. I'm here to try and solve the problem. Do you remember when the curse started?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gabriela Macario: Once we moved into that cursed house</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gabriela Macario does the sign of the cross</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gabriela Macario: It whispered to us. Tempting things. Cruel things</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gabriela Macario: Vittorio... he couldn't... it got into him</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: And since leaving, has it appeard to you?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gabriela Macario: No, no, God Bless</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: It's only going to be 10pm when we're done here, plenty of time to get into the house o:</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carl Handy: can I add a masonry trowel to my items</font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; Carl Handy: Sure can</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Thank you Gabriel. I hope what you've given me can help me bring you and your husband some peace. Do you know how the devil can get out? What I can do to stop that from happening?</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Carmen Santamonica): Gabriela*</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gabriela Macario: No. I don't... I don't.... we must pray to God, we must pray</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gabriela Macario: It did such terrible things</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Thank you Gabriela. Doctor, I don't think there's anything else she can tell me.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dr Flynn: Of course. </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Dr Flynn takes Carmen away, leaving Gabriela behind to pray</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dr Flynn: You must remember, it's merely a figment of her imagination. Stress, and her husband's job and temperment going south. These things can sometimes be seasonal, and they're not used to the cold of the winters up here</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dr Flynn: Mr Macario is much worse off. He's not fit for discussion, he spends most of his days in his room. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Of course. Speaking of her husband. Has he been coherent at all since being admitted?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dr Flynn: Barely. A few bouts, but most of it is paranoia and anger. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: And during these moments, the things he was saying, did they line up with the reports his wife was giving?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dr Flynn: Like his wife, it's mostly rants about the devil and evil. Unlike his wife, he seems to be using this as an excuse to vent his frustrations</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dr Flynn: Oh, quite. They both sound like they were overstressed and overworked. Uncommon, but not unheard of in today's society. Especially in the cities, with as little nature around as they have</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: A real tragic turn these days, for sure. Thank you doctor. I should be meeting back up with my collegues(sp).</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">It's worth noting that the house's yard is almost entirely in shadow now due to the buildings on either side.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): &#62;:T </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Stepping out of the sanitarium, Carmen has something to think about as she heads back toward Boston to meet up with her partners. The three of them gather for a late dinner to discuss their plans</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Doin the fern face at @ u Lanta</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: &#60;3</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">There's a few places for them to go, but the most obvious ones are to check out the house itself or to check out the old Chapel. </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica: The party meets back up and shares notes. Carmen gets filled in on the Chapel</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica: And the will</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carl Handy: and the Professor are similarily caught up on the happenings with the businessman and the sanitorium.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: (POLL) Ready to go?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: You can tell he wasn't here because of the zzz</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Where do you want to go from here?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: You can either do it as OOC or you can do it as RP. Something like...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica: They head to the old location of the Chapel's HQ</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Ms Booker: I think we should go to the church first, before we go to the house</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: ^Something like that</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Y'all can make a Discord channel o:</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: We do that in my other campaign to bounce ideas off each other</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Why would we hide from the GM! </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): She's our friend!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: &#62;:3c</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Of course she is what are you TALKING about??</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Presuming you'll be dead at the end</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Are you going at night then?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Or sleeping first?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: We got some things in a to-do list yeah</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Carmen Santamonica): We got some things in a to-do list yeah</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">It's a little difficult to navigate in the darkness, but it doesn't take too long. Only a few blocks from the house, they find what's left of the church. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The ruins are so weathered and overgrown with greenery that the stone rubble seems more like natural stone than former walls and foundation. You pass a slumping wall bearing white-painted grafiti which looks concerningly like an eye. It's hard to feel like you're not being watched as you pick your way through. </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica attempts to push the delapidated wall with the eye, the rest of the way over, or at least smudge the image some way</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: STR check</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carmen Santamonica: [ABILITY] Strength Check (60%) [Fail] (Spend 25 of your 40 luck to succeed.)</font> [d100 = 85]<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: The heads in the walls</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Nope, you can push as well if you want</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Here, give me a hand with this</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: With all three of you pushing, Carl can roll with a Bonus die</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Yup</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: One bonus die total. Exactly!</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Hit the +B, then double click STR</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carl Handy: [BON][ABILITY] Strength Check (60%) [Extreme success]</font> [d100+t100 = 11]<br />
<font color="#261A12">With the three of you pushing on it, the wall begins to creak. Slowly, you feel something give, and the barrier collapses with a loud crash. Looking at it in the moonlight, the symbol is smashed to pieces along with the wall. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Mine?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: :3</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica dusts her hands off and takes a better look around the ruins</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Nice job gents.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: It was looking at me strange</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The empty yard waits for you in the moonlight. You can see what used to be the chapel doors ahead of you, long since burnt to cinders</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Nope, still in the yard for it</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carl Handy: smiles, happy to have had a task in his wheelhouse at last.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: You pushed down the exterior wall</font><br />
<font color="#005500">Mogstew (Carl Handy): can I use my art skill to examine some of the graffiti to see if I can determine anything about it?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Do we see more of those symbols around?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Roll a Spot Hidden check</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Each of you roll a Spot Hidden as you make your way in. Who has flashlights out?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): All of us yeah </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Also you can absolutely roll with your Art Skill</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carl Handy: [SKILL] Spot Hidden (30%) [Fumble]</font> [d100 = 99]<br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Yup</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: [SKILL] Spot Hidden (35%) [Fail]</font> [d100 = 62]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Does flashlight give bonus?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl has an eye for art, but unfortunately only an eye for art. He's so focused on the piece of rubble that he's largely blind to anything else</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Carl, can you roll your ARt skill for me? </font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carl Handy: [SKILL] Art/Craft - Carpentry (65%) [Hard success] (Spend 11 of your 60 luck to make it an Extreme Success.)</font> [d100 = 24]<br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Carmen, can you roll your Spot Hidden for me?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carmen Santamonica: [SKILL] Spot Hidden (60%) [Extreme success]</font> [d100 = 12]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl notices that the lines and eye shape are drawn with an unexpected level of precision. Usually graffiti is pretty haphazard, or applies its messiness in artistic expression. But this involved a lot of care with how the lines and oval were drawn while not really expressing much. Just a plain series of white lines. Even the pupil, from what he can see in the rubble, is a near-perfect circle.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen leads the way into the building with the professor at her back. It's fortunate she lead the way, too, since she's the one who notices that it's not just blocks of granite and half-burnt timbers. The floor they're standing on isn't just wood-on-earth anymore, and the wood creaks dangerously.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">There's a basement here.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Hold on everyone.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: This floor might not be stable</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Seems like theres a basement and these boards are very old</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl realizes, a bit belatedly, that he's the only one still outside</font><br />
<font color="#005500">Mogstew (Carl Handy): I would like to regroup</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Go ahead and make a Luck roll for me</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carl Handy: [ABILITY] Luck Check (60%) [Regular success]</font> [d100 = 43]<br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Don't get bonked Carl!! </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The shiver at being alone in the moonlight is enough to put a bit of pep in Carl's step as he heads in. Fortunately, the heavy thump of his boots don't dislodge the floorboards more than they already are. As the group peers around to the left, they find that there's a large hole between some of the old pews. Across the room from them to the right, a door sits nestled into the wall, swung open and displaying the staircase. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: If you shoved Carl down onto it, you'd find out pretty quickly</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Okay, carefully toward the door then, I'll go first. Professor watch my back. Carl, you've got his.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: You could creep over toward the door to take a peek, you can't tell how safe it is from here. </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica ^ does that</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Who else is going with Carmen?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: That's your perogative o:</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): We should stay together!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Then maybe one at a time?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Nope, you're not too large to cause that. But anyone who wants to go will have to make a Luck check to avoid trouble. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Yeah you have 60 lol</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): You both have 60, I've got 40</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: The walls themselves are pretty intact, though you could try sneaking around the outside and climbing up and over the wall from the outside. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: The ceiling has collapsed a long time ago. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I can go first</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Luck Check from Carmen</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Luck Check from Carmen</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Oh goodie! </font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carmen Santamonica: [ABILITY] Luck Check (40%) [Fail]</font> [d100 = 81]<br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): ;u;</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I knew that was gonna happen!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">As she sneaks over, Carmen misjudges the weight that one of the boards can take. She hears a sickening crunch, and has only a moment to Jump to safety</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Jump Check</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carmen Santamonica: [SKILL] Jump (40%) [Regular success] (Spend 3 of your 40 luck to make it a Hard Success.)</font> [d100 = 23]<br />
<font color="#000000">GM: If you want to make it a Hard success, you can jump forward instead of back</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Nope</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Carmen Santamonica): having less than 50 luck means never spending luck :D</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Jumping back, a portion of the floor collapses to form a second hole. There's still floor that can be safely traversed to get to the door, but you imagine you have only one or two more incidents like that before &#34;over the wall&#34; is the only way you'll get to the basement stairs. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: So, what do y'all wanna commit to? :3</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: It might be safer for us to go around and climb over the wall?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: If the three of us work together to get over the wall it might be less dangerous than trying to cross this floor</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Sneaking out around, the trio make it to the wall. There's some rubble, but it still will take some effort to climb. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: OH! No you gotta pick a science. What kinda science?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Biology, Astronomy, Political, etc</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): History tho Just sayin</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You can get a bonus die if there's someone available to give you a boost, but whoever goes last is going to have to roll plain Climb</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Unfortunately we're all a 20</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Not really by other stats, but you could try to do things that give you a bonus die if you can think of something</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Sure can, though it'll take some time with the other two helping you. Wanna roll it?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Go for it</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): We have pretty bad climb skills</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Probably a half hour or so</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Make a Mechanical Repair roll to identify if you can find weak spots on the wall</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Can we all?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Same but </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Yeah, sure</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carl Handy: [SKILL] Mech Repair (55%) [Hard success]</font> [d100 = 17]<br />
<font color="#660066">Carmen Santamonica: [SKILL] Mech Repair (10%) [Fail] (Spend 32 of your 40 luck to succeed.)</font> [d100 = 42]<br />
<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: [SKILL] Mech Repair (10%) [Fail] (Spend 59 of your 60 luck to succeed.)</font> [d100 = 69]<br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): NICE</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): You should give that to him becasue 69 should be a crit win</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl does spot a portion of the wall, not one that can be knocked down, but one where a piece of rebar could be wedged in to give an easier climbing route. With the brickwork damaged as it is, there's plenty of handholds for the three to make it up past the toughest part. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: (One of the live plays I watched counted 69 as a critical)</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Fantastic omg</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: There is no rebar</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The rebar is easy to find and implement. It takes a lot less time than expected to get everything in place. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: I was faking you out &#62;:3c</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Got us D:</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Okay so does that give us +2B or can we just get over the wall now?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: No roll necessary for climbing, that will suffice</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): NICE!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica: Okay so we all get over the wall then</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Climbing over the wall and dropping down, the trio are left standing next to the open stairway. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Who's first?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I'll go first</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: -</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: -</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I think Carl is trying to communicate...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Ladies first?  Seeing as how you've got a gun and all...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Gladly.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Professor why don't you follow and I'll bring up the rear</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Keep a hammer ready</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Leading the way, the group wanders down to the basement space. It looks like a bit of a storage space, but you can see where the boards collapsed earlier. A false wall, cracked apart and exposing a part of the basement separate from the rest of the basement. </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carl Handy: readies his grandfathers clawhammer.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): FLAVOR</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: No secret tunnels yet, but if you want to wander around and make a Spot Hidden roll you can look for one</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: You can do that whenever you want</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Profressor, can you check the storage for any documents that may be of interest? Carl, let's go check that wall.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Just can't change it after you do</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Sounds good.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carmen Santamonica: [SKILL] Spot Hidden (60%) [Regular success] (Spend 13 of your 40 luck to make it a Hard Success.)</font> [d100 = 43]<br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Spot Hidden</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carl Handy: [SKILL] Spot Hidden (30%) [Regular success]</font> [d100 = 19]<br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Library Use would be used to sort through, read, and parse all the documents. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Spot Hidden from the Professor?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: [SKILL] Spot Hidden (35%) [Regular success] (Spend 7 of your 60 luck to make it a Hard Success.)</font> [d100 = 24]<br />
<font color="#261A12">The professor spends a fair bit of time sorting through the main area of the basement, but does not find much of anything</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yay good rolls! :D</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen and Carl, though, find some interesting things. An altar sits on the far side, with a cabinet and two skeletons that are dressed in tattered silk robes. Perhaps they were hiding here during the fire? </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Hey professor...we got some skeletons over here...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica checks the cabnet</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Official List</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Sounds good :D</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: XD</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Ideally, yeah, but we kinda just set these precons up immediately</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The cabinet contains a series of old papers, most of which crumble to the touch. But one piece, viewed by flashlight, lets Carmen catch a few words before it crumbles: &#34;Corbitt&#34;, &#34;basement&#34;, &#34;in accordance with his wishes&#34;and &#34;the one who waits in the dark&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica relays this to her companions</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl, leaning on the altar, notices that it has a small cubby on the front. Leaning down, he pulls out a small, leatherbound tomb.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: What're you looking for with Forensics?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Carl, can you add &#34;Liber Ivonis&#34; to your character sheet? </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Just wanna do a Forensics xD</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: That's the book you just found, mhm</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">It's etched into the front of the black leather book. Opening it up gives about as much meaning; it looks like the whole thing is in anotherlanguage. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Roll your Other Language (Latin)</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: As a history professor, what era of history do you specialize in?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I took Latin as my forign language in highschool :D</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Oh, no list</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): You should take Latin</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Latin, Egyptian, Cherokee, Indian, Swahili, French, etc</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Unless we're anti-meta-gaming</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Latin's honestly a really good pick</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Even with metagaming considering, it's really really common</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: What's the other one?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: That's a great choice c:</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Primacy</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Mhm</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Carl has no Latin</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: So uh</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carl Handy: holds the books towards the professor.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Hey prof, can you make any sense of this?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Looking at the size, it'll take the Professor about 3 hours to skim through. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Any pronouns are fine</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Well, you could do it while following Carl and I around</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): But you would be occupied</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Roll it \o/</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: We might want to make understanding that book a priority, seems important if they kept it in the alter</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: How long do you want to spend? More time=more info</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Go for like a 10min search lol</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: You're in the middle of the night with flashlights in an abandoned chapel</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Roll it \o/</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: [SKILL] Science - Forensics (65%) [Regular success] (Spend 2 of your 60 luck to make it a Hard Success.)</font> [d100 = 34]<br />
<font color="#000000">GM: No need</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The bodies have no notable wounds to them, though they are gross to the touch. It's reasonable to assume that they died of suffocation or the like, given the soot and grime both above and below them. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">They're both above a layer and below a layer, suggesting they were moving around as the fire burned</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Probably about a decade or so, but it's really hard to tell. Definitely not 100s of years. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: We need to tell the police about this...</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: It *is* weird that this was never uncovered</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): That's a spooky notion o.o</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">That appears to be most of it. While checking out the bodies, Carmen and Carl continue to filter around, but there don't appear to be much else down here. No secret tunnels, at least. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: I think we need to get out of here and find a phonebooth to call the police station.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Time to make our way back out</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Professor can you see about that book while we call the police?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: No phonebooths yet</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carl Handy: absentmindedly reaches towards the small saint medallion on the necklace under his shirt.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Climbing back up the stairs, the group climbs their way back up and out of the ruins. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): If we don't then we just head for the house</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Yup, occasionally. You can find one, or head to the station.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">With book in tow, the group is free to head out to their next place. It is getting late, though, and continued operation may result in CON checks to stay awake. They can head to the station, to the house, or to one of their own homes (they presumably live in the area, after all)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I wouldn't want to get caught up in police red tape while we've got a deadline</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: I hate to keep a secret but you are probably right.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I say we stay at the house over night so we can get started early in the morning</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): ha ha</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: That seems logical.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Professor can you start on that book tonight?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The house itself is pretty close, so the group heads over toward it. It's almost midnight by the time they arrive, the moon high in the sky</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Unlocking the front door goes smoothly, and opens up to the interior...</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: And through the windows :D</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: I think you can click each other to share their viewpoints</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Lemme grab room details :3</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: This isn't a very speific battlemap, but will suffice to tell which room each person is in</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The front door opens to a small foyer. To the left hang long abandoned overcoats, galoshes, hats and umbrellas. Several bags of coal sit to the right.&#13;&#13;There's an open doorway to the right leading into the parlour. A stairwell leads directly in front of you, leading to a landing which leads both to another room on the other side and to the second floor. The northwest corner of the room is cut off, and a door sits diagonal to the walls there.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Mr. Knott mentioned having power and water service here, why don't we get the lights on.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Flicking the switch, the lights do not turn on. Circuit breaker must have tripped at some point.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: I'll take a look and see if I can find the breaker to take a look.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You can see the parlour from here, the fireplace sitting on the far side of the room. The building is deathly quiet as your flashlights sweep across dozens and dozens of crosses, all stuck to the walls firmly.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Are the other two of you waiting in the reception space or do you wanna head to the parlour?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Or do you wanna go with Carl?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">There are chairs and couches in the parlour</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">There's some wood by the fireplace as well, making it perfect for a cozy evening. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: How 'bout Carmen?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The Professor heads in and lights a fire, putting on the wood and coal to get it going and provide some light. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I accentally closed the map window! D: I'd like to go with Carl </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Oh thank you GM &#60;3</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Nope, you can start reading now</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Nope :D</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Listening closely, the house is silent. The crackle from the fire in the other room is barely audible. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I don't hear anything Carl, go ahead</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">A conventional kitchen, with icebox, wood-fed stove and oven, plus a meager larder. Some of the foodstuffs may be edible; there is canned soup and meat, rice kernels, several pastas and a few bottles of homemade wine. The rest of the produce is either spoiled or consumed by rats, which appear to have had quite the feast.&#13;&#13; An exterior door sits on the north side of the room, with three deadbolts and a chain locking it shut. On the west side of the south wall is a little set of stairs leading to a landing, and beyond that another room. On the east side of the south wall is a closed interior door.</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Ez</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Getting back up to it, you move a can to the side and jump back as a rat scurries out. It leaps down to the floor, scampering under the table and into a hole in the cabinet on the east side of the wall</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Carl flips the breaker with a satisfying click. With a flick if the light, the lights all come on</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Glancing up at the assortment of things in the reception room, the professor notes that there are a few sets of kids coats and adults. They're old, and covered in dust.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The room he's in is similarly dusty, though the bags of coal were not. A mix of things that've been restocked, probably by Knott, and things that were left by the house's last occupants. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: With the lights on, where do y'all want to go? </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Good idea</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Carl follow me while I finish the main floor.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Sure thing.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">This is the dining room, complete with a long mahogany table, a built-in sideboard and seven chairs. Three places are set and unused. Scraps of rice soup rot in a tureen.&#13;&#13;There's a fireplace in the southeast corner of the room, with the room's only door to the southwest.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: lol yes he did</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Though in the future, I'm going to make people stick their head up there to check</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: No, you just gotta tell me where to go or what you're looking?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Oh I was gonna do a whole ass raccoon</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): XD</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): ANYWAY</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Let's head up. I want the group together before we touch that basement</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Carl and Carmen heading upstairs?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">Mogstew (Carl Handy): yep I follow Carmens lead</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Say again? </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: No roll, just a matter of time</font><br />

<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: [SKILL] History (70%) [Fumble]</font> [d100 = 100]<br />
<font color="#000000">GM: LMAO</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Never having heard of this book before, Professor Plato flips through the pages, taking in the text one section at a time. It seems to be something religious or occultish. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: You can use that later</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl and Carmen give a little wave toward the professor as they pass to head up the stairs. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: There's a door at the top to the back yard</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: It's got three deadbolts, so you're pretty sure that's the most secure door in the house</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Which door do you want? </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The house has four rooms on the first floor, and four on the second (plus a bathroom)</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Illy &#60;3</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Lanta! &#60;3</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Yeah it's in the Hallway</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: That's this one over here</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: No door, it just leads right on down</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Mhmhm</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Just like magnets</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Which door do you want?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Top left door</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Good job Hawu!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: You can if you click their tokens, I think</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Over to the right</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I saw it</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Deselect yourself for a moment</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The door opens up to a kid's room, a small room with a single bed. Childrens' toys sit around, long since abandoned. Up to the north end of the room is the window, dusty and grimey, and a half-open door to a closet. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: You can flick them on, yes</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Good idea Carl!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Window goofballs</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Fun fact, this is a real floorplan from the 1920s</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): &#34;A lotta feet&#34; is a unit of measurement</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: You can if you rub it clean</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Hawu just experienced a segfault</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carl Handy: walks to the window and tries to rub the grime off with his rag.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Either or</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I like to take actions and let the GM tell me what happens as a result</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: I like it, it confirms that you've made a decision</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Hey you had one</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Wiping the window clean, Carl looks out to the back yard. There's not much to see, given that the property is boxed up in between taller buildings, but he can see the little dead yard. Nobody outside.</font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; Professor Plato: Make a Listen check</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Want into the closet? </font><br />
<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: [SKILL] Listen (20%) [Hard success] (Spend 5 of your 60 luck to make it an Extreme Success.)</font> [d100 = 9]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I'll check the closet</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): We don't know that though!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The closet is small and cramped, clothing missing from the hangers. The floorboards in the corner are rotted through, and you can see a hole which may have once been used by a rat. </font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; Professor Plato: You hear a thump from the dining room, as if something heavy just fell down over there.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Would you like to reach into it?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Wanna describe it or do you want me to?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Carmen do you want me to take a look into that hole?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Carl you're looking into the rat den?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Go right ahead, Mr. Handy. I&#34;ll help with my flashlight.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: You can do &#34;/w gm&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Dalge drank the rest of my rum :(</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: would like to investigate sound</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carl Handy: gets on his hands and knees and peers into the hole as best he can.</font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; GM: Taking the book with you or leaving it on the table?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Because Dalge drank it &#62;:T (I drank most of it tho)</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yes! I room with one of my best friends from snice middle school and his gf! :D</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Driven??</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl leans down to peer into the hole and sees right out the other side. It looks like this little section of wall has largely been cleared out of insulation. Rat droppings and scratch marks indicate what did it. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Excuse you both, this is by choice</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You can actually see down toward the first floor from here</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Then you should do it</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): absolutely</font><br />

<font color="#000000">GM: Are you yelling full volume? </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Talk in a normal tone</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I like Jim Gaffagin</font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; GM: Wandering into the dining room, you don't see anyone nor anything. There's a tureen with rotten rice soup, a large dagger stabbed ito the table, seven chairs, and the fireplace in the corner.</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Clickling only</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Wait</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Is that the one where you watch someone else click your mouse?</font><br />

<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: how do i respond? what is carl doing in the wall??</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Wait the professor is british?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato: Carl, what are you doing in the wall??</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: I'm not in the wall professor...We are upstairs in a kids bedroom and there is hole in the floor that seems to connect to the ground floor.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Looks like the place has a pretty bad rat infestation. Probably through the whole house. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Are you good down there?</font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; Professor Plato: You hear a creak come from the hallway. Then another, and another, and another, moving away from you.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: follow the noise</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Professor you should answer our good handyman</font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; Professor Plato: Turning your flashlight on, you head out to the hallway. You could swear you heard someone walk down the stairs. Looking down, the stairwell makes a turn partway down, preventing you from seeing the basement from here.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Anything else of interest in the closet?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato: we good fam</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): 1925 everyone</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Let's do that, just open doors and check for anything wild at first glance</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Both! :D</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Two beds sit in this room, along with a large wardrobe. Again, another closet, and a number of dolls that someone had pointed at the door for some reason. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): No realtion to the big red hat</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">A bathroom containing a sink, bathtub and a water closet with an overhead tank. Towels and other possessions are still here, typical to a family of four. A brackish pool of water has collected in the bathtub. A single bubble rises to the surface of the opaque water.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Professional respect and &#34;Same name&#34; instead of &#34;Same hat&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: return to the group to relay weird noises</font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; Professor Plato: Returning to them through the basement stairs or the 2nd floor stairs? c:</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">This room contains a bed frame, bare bedsprings and a dresser. Though unused, this room looks like the other bedrooms.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">An ordinary bedroom, with a double bed, bookshelf and window view. Apparently the room of Vittorio and Gabriela. The room is positively covered in crosses, with several bibles sitting along the book shelves. Beads from a rosary, long since broken, lie scattered across the floor.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">In none of the rooms do the group find signs of anyone... except...</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): DON&#34;T GO DOWN THERE</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">As the group of you discuss upstairs, something thumps from downstairs. You all hear it, and the lights flicker alongside a second thump. There, standing in between the three of you for just a moment as the light flickers, is a man.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): WOAH</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">With that, the lights shut off once more. And they do not turn back on</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">As Carl, Carmen, and the Professor discuss their plans on the upstairs landing, something thumps from downstairs. They all hear it, and the lights flicker alongside a second thump. Then, a third. And there, standing in between the three of them for just a moment as the light flickers, is a man. Just as soon as he is there, he's gone, and so are the lights. </font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Because that was a mistake</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Sitting on top of the professor is Carmen, who's got the man pinned below her. As the light shines over, both of them realize that the professor's wrists, while pinned behind his back, are holding a flashlight in one hand and a rusty knife in the other.

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I rolled attack</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Flailing about, the professor does little to change his circumstances. With nowhere to go, he seems to run out of energy after 10 seconds or so, breathing heavily on the ground as he comes back to his senses</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): My bad</font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; Professor Plato: You're back in control. You have no recollection of picking up this knife, but you realize it's the one that you saw stabbed into the kitchen table earlier.</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Just control is more for paragraph</font><br />

<font color="#880000">Professor Plato drops the knife</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Like this</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica: She heaves a sigh of relief before removing herself from the professor's back and helping him to his feet. She carefully picks the knife up by the grip and examines it</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): That was an act</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yeah we should leave xD</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Do you remember where you got this?</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Got any banages in that toolkit of yours?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Unless the GM says so!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Perfect!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Can I assist?</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Gm what am I i  rolling?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The knife itself is in poor condition, but the handle is strangely ornate. It's a near-black laquered wooden handle, carved with intricate geometric patterns.</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Please don't say I lose the bonus die</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: You may push that if you want. You'll need a new patch of his shirt, which isn't as clean, so it's possible that this might make it worse overall rather than better. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Still bonus?</font><br />

<font color="#660066"> -&#62; Professor Plato: While examining the knife, and the stuff on the blade, you scratch some off and realize that it's not really rust. It's like a mix of rust and... congealed blood?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): An ARTESINAL cheese knife  </font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: That came from the basement. We should head for the front door, keep an ear out for the doors to the reception or the kitchen from that hallway.</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">The trio head down the stairs, slowly making their way into the darkness. A rat scurries through the reception room and into the parlour</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yeh to the hallway with the basement, both doors are open</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Ty Lanta &#60;3</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yes</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Okay I'm gonna 50/50 this </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): High is Kitchen low is Reception</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carmen Santamonica: </font> [d100 = 46]<br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica fishes the keys from her coat</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica and makes sure she has the front door key ready</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Also to make sure it didn't lock on us</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Okay, stay behind me</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Shhhh</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: I've got your back Carmen.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Make a what??</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: We get out?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yes absolutely</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The trio runs out the door, pushing past it and slamming it shut behind them. Carmen pauses for only a moment to lock the door, which takes far too long for comfort, but she's finally able to pull away and rush back out. The three of them stand on the street, looking at the little house, the light from the fire in the fireplace shining out through the dirty parlour window. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: So...to make sure I'm not losing it here...we all saw the same thing on the stairs when the power went out.  Right?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Time for a quick review. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Lanta that isn't gonna burn the house down if we leave the fire burning?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Probably not, it's a fire in a fireplace</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I don't have a knowldge of 1920s fire places!!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Ty </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Carl. You saw the figure as well?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Yes.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Lanta how detailed can I remember the image that I saw in that moment? Is that something I can roll for?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Sure can, that'll be an INT check</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): The face, features, anything to identify the suspect</font><br />

<font color="#000000">GM: The figure was a haunting one. It was hairless, wrinkled, almost fetid. It was only there for a fraction of a second, its eyes sunken and deep and empty. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): OH NO</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: You left the book inside?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The light from the fireplace goes out</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica draws her pistol and unlocks the door. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Stay here.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato [English]: i was investigating the sounds when everything happened</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Professor Plato, Carl Handy, Carmen Santamonica]</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Flashlight on? </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yes</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: What are you doing with the dagger towel?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Leaving it with Carl.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: I think this is a crazy idea, for the record</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carl Handy takes the dagger towel and sticks it into his tool pouch.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: So do I. But I got a bad feeling about that book.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yes</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Pound on the back door</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): It should still be locked and bolted</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carl Handy and the professor head around the back of the house and begin to pound on the back door</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Opening up the front door door, Carmen slips back into the house. Turning the corner from the reception, the flashlight shines across the parlour. Several rats leap off of the little side table, scurrying under other furniture. Sitting on the table is the book.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica sweeps the room with her flashlight before meaning to head straight for the book, and straight back out of the house</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">And out she goes, leaving the dark house behind her with the book in tow</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Locked</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Let's take the rest of the night away from this place.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Nope time to go xD</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Boy am I glad he's trapped in there and we're out ehre</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Carl's place!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: I live nearby.  Given the hour and...what we just experienced.  Do you two want to spend the night there? </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I wouldn't be opposed to having a shorter trip. And some company after what we just experienced</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato [English]: Let's do that. we can continue to look around here in the morning when it's hopefully less spooky</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Professor Plato, Carl Handy, Carmen Santamonica]</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The trio make it back to Carl's place. He lets them into the apartment, which is tidy but disorganized. Nicknacks cover the shelves, alongside tools and spare parts like nails and twine. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): It's probably better in the hands of a person who can translate it xD</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carl Handy: [ABILITY] Luck Check (60%) [Fail]</font> [d100 = 96]<br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): These rolls are TRASH</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl does not have a safe, but he does have an open spot in his knife rack in the kitchen</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: We gotta at least hide these things before we go to sleep</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Who are we hiding them from?  Ourselves?  What a wonderful thought...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: At least lock the door then.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Of course</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): FOUR??</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: I'll leave the lights on too</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): The monster's here too</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Morning comes all too soon, or perhaps not soon enough. None of the trio gets a good night's sleep, but you're awaken in daylight at the end of it all. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Just hanging out</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Love you all</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Quick break! Be back in 6</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): &#60;3</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Hello I'm back!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I have no context! :D</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Blissful ignorance</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Okay, let's recount the events of the evening.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Time check? 6am?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The figure was a man's, hairless with tattered clothes. It had no lips, its teeth exposed, and its eyes. Its eyes were terrible, dark saucers reflecting a light that wasn't there.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Professor Plato: tries to recall details of the figure encountered</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Ctrl shift for those Star</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: That thing we saw.  It looked more like a decaying corpse than a living person</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: And we're all in agreement that we saw the same thing?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: It happened so fast, but it sure sounds like it.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato [English]: wish i hadn't seen it, but it sounds the same</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Professor Plato, Carl Handy, Carmen Santamonica]</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: That would rule out a trick of the light. We all saw a figure, from three different angles. All facing the same direction. There one moment and gone the next. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Shortly after the experience, good doctor Plato lost his mental grip and attacked in the dark, finding himself with a knife.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Professor**</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Professor, you saw this knife in the kitchen?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: But do not remember retrieving it before ascending the stairs?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato [English]: yes, the knife was stabbed into the kitchen table. i do not recall grabbing the knife before investigating the sounds that lead into the basement</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Professor Plato, Carl Handy, Carmen Santamonica]</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: It's worth mentioning that neither Carmen nor Carl recognize this knife from their trip through the kitchen and dining room. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Where did you go when investigating the sounds?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Then I have to wonder, how did you have the knife by the time you made it upstairs? Either you were given it in the dark during the moments of confusion, or you had it in your hands as you walked up stairs. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Also, profressor you are not a suspect here. There are several things that are unexplainable. I'd like to narrow them down.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Knife sits innocently on the table, as a knife do</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato [English]: the first sounds were from Carl yelling into the whole. then there were sounds of footsteps that lead to the basement. which is when i went upstairs</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Professor Plato, Carl Handy, Carmen Santamonica]</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: So you never entered the kitchen?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: You just saw the knife in the table?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: THINK man!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato [English]: i went from the parlour to the dining room (Carl yelling), towards the basement stairs, then upstairs through the kitchen without stopping in the kitchen</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Professor Plato, Carl Handy, Carmen Santamonica]</font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; Professor Plato: &#34;Wandering into the dining room, you don't see anyone nor anything. There's a tureen with rotten rice soup, a large dagger stabbed ito the table, seven chairs, and the fireplace in the corner. It's about that point when you hear Carl from...the wall?&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Is there a connection from the parlour to the dining room??</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): There is no connection from the parlor to the dining room according to the floor plan</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: No obvious connection from the parlour to the dining room, though they do share a fireplace structure</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): You mean the movie, &#34;Holes&#34; right?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yelnats...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: We should take the dagger to an antique shop, while we do, Professor follow along and figure out what's in that book.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I like having it as an option</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carmen Santamonica: [ABILITY] Knowledge Check (60%) [Hard success] (Spend 3 of your 40 luck to make it an Extreme Success.)</font> [d100 = 15]<br />
<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: [SKILL] Archaeology (50%) [Fail] (Spend 35 of your 60 luck to succeed.)</font> [d100 = 85]<br />
<font color="#261A12">There's a small used bookshop that Carmen knows about, Speaks Volumes. They also carry little nicknacks and serve as a pawnshop to older things. </font><br />
<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: [SKILL] Science - Forensics (65%) [Fail] (Spend 3 of your 60 luck to succeed.)</font> [d100 = 68]<br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Don't spend. let's go check it with the shop keep</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato doesn't have any historical insights on the dagger. It doesn't appear to be ancient egyptian, at least. It's a more recent dagger than that at least. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Not a bad idea! </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): We probably do want to go bad before night fall </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yes</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): No, we probably don't need another gun</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Maybe lanturns to set up in each room</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Shovels</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: You can pick up lanterns or lamps</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Lanturns for each room to make it easier to see if the stuff goes out</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Good call</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: At least one per room</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Shovels</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: We need shovels, maybe a pick axe</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Ooc prediction time again</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): The thing we saw is the guy who's burried in the basement. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): He's haunting the place</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): We gotta destroy or purify the corpse or something</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Hmmm</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Should we report to Knott?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Give him a ring?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Preliminary findings?</font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; Carmen Santamonica: Can I have you roll a D100 for the shopkeeper, Malachi Hodges, to check out the knife? You need a 60 or below</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carmen Santamonica: </font> [d100 = 27]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: &#34;Okay so, place has some structural problems. The electrics are on the fritz. The piping might have problems. It's infested with rats. There might be a body burried in the basement aaand it's probably haunted. Working on that though.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Hey, he should know!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: It can't hurt to tell him.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Hehehe</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">At the bookshop, Carmen speaks with Malachi Hodges, owner of Speaks Volumes. </font><br />
<font color="#000066">Malachi Hodges: Yeah, this is a good piece of work. It's a real knife, but it's replicating the sort of work that you'd see in Irish or Scandanavian tools from the 800s. Definitely not that old, though, I'd guess probably only a hundred or two. I'd give you $50 for it if it were in good condition, but only $30 for this condition. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Thanks Malachi. Anything you can tell me about the book?</font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; Carmen Santamonica: Roll another d100, 75% or below</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carmen Santamonica: </font> [d100 = 41]<br />
<font color="#000066">Malachi Hodges: This... where did you get this from? </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Questions aren't answers, my friend.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: The less you know is probably the better</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Malachi Hodges: I don't know if this is a forgery or not, but if it is it's a damn good one. It looks like a copy of the Book of Eibon, a translation copied from a monk back in the 9th centery. It's valuable. I'd take this to the Miskatonic University, see if they'd be willing to verify its authenticity and take it in. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Okay, what can you tell me about it? What's in the book?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Malachi Hodges: Story about a wizard, I think. I've never held a copy before</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Professor, do you think there would be somoene who could check this for us at this time of day?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato [English]: no one that would be available today</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">The book is a translation by Caius Phillipus Faber of another book. Many of the pages are rotten through, but the parts you can make out contain accounts of a powerful wizard, Eibon, as he adventures in the Vale of Pnath and Shaggai. It has whole excerpts which pause the story to provide detail about the spells and rituals he performed, knowledge granted to him by both elder gods and beings that the book refers to only as &#34;Old Ones&#34;.</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Only Carl remained...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl recognizes that the repeating patterns are pretty similar between some of the diagrams in the book and the knife. It's a lot of swirling shapes, spirals with other curves tucked into them. It's not a direct match, but perhaps the knife was inspired by some of this?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Carl could learn more by making his own knife like this in his downtime uwu</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Actually that's not a bad idea... we could also need the knife to help stop this if it's got all these intracate carvings</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): So, did we establish that his black out was a posession??</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Sequence of events?</font><br />

<font color="#000000">GM: So for sequence of events, what did you mean? </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: We don't really have much of any other explination as to why the professor started freaking out</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Unless he was actually just having a panic attack</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The thing seemed to just appear in the group, and freaked everyone out. It did not do anything particular toward the Professor (didn't talk, didn't gesture, etc)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">It is quite possible it was just a panic attack</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Okay, if he rolled bad enough he might have just started pannicing?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Exactly!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Okay okay</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): He was speaking in latin yeah</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Okay xD So we can move away from &#34;posession&#34; then</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I had to go back in for it</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Okay, let's check out the basement while we still have light</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Yes</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">The knife is still weirdly grimey for being wrapped in a towel. That gunk is really stuck on the blade.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD  </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Do you want to try cleaning it Carl?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Okay</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Yes, I have some paint thinner and rags here.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Let's not</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Heh, it's an AI generated picture so probably nothing</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Lanta actually helped me figure that out</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl uses the paint thinner and rags to clean the dagger off, and it cleans off probably 90% of the gunk on it. The blade itself does have similar etchings to the handle. </font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Okay fine</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Nah, let's go in, open all the windows in the house, then go in</font><br />

<font color="#005500">GM: Cantaine</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I spelled that wrong :D</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Like, light and such yes</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: That's not a bad idea iCarly</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): My sister watched it a lot, I was a bit old</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">There is a window to the back yard which is at ground level, and some dim light does reach it despite the dead tree in the yard and the buildings surounding the yard. It looks like it can lever open, but not from the outside. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): The lead producer is also a known weirdo</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">None of the buildings that surround this property have windows on this side, so it's just solid bricks on all sides. </font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): WEIRD</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): But okay</font><br />
<font color="#880000">iCarly Handy leans down and hits the glass with his clawhammer.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Are we still outside?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I assume so</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The window shatters, and nothing grabs Carl to drag him inside.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Y'all are in the back yard still</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Carl, are you okay over there?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: I don't know what's going on in this house but I didn't like the idea of being stuck in there and not being able to find or open this window...in case things go weird.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The back yard does have a tree, as well as a pile of lumber and a few other building supplies under a tarp</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: That's... a good thought.</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Carl is unsure of his footing. He could try to push the roll, but if he fails he's likely to lose his footing and take a tumble.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): We could still tie another rope up this side??</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Carl pulls the dining room table to the door, scraping along the hardwood. He ties more of his rope to the leg, and uses that to help himself  down the stairs. </font><br />

<font color="#261A12">With the extra support, he makes his way down the stairwell. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The basement is small, the window providing way better light than the dim light bulb in the ceiling. Three walls are made of stone, with the last being wooden planks with hooks and rods on it to hang up tools which are long since missing. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: We should grab lanturns to light the area</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">It's full of garbage, the east half of the room being buried in boxes, tables, and other smaller things crammed in there</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Why not she asks omg</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Okay. Let's grab a lanturn or two and make sure we have enough light, then we knock down that wooden wall.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Sledgehammer too</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Sledgehammer!</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Okei</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl heads out to grab some lanterns from his car, a pry bar, shovels, sledgehammer, a molotov, and paint thinner. As he makes it to the car, he sees the bed frame on the street, a chunk missing from the pavement where it hit the street maybe 6 inches in front of his car. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Can we think of a couple more things?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: We need to think of a way to deal with the rats</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I'm thinkning as soon as we try to get across that junk they'll probably get after us</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">On the reverse side, the cloud hangs a balance. A scale measures a bag on the left, labeled 1 &#38; 3L below it. On the right is  stone, 12.KR below it. Between the bowls is IMAAS BIER 8&#189; KR. On the state line is an anchor and a sheaf grain, left and right, grain clusters. Caption: VERZAGET NICHT - GOTT OR LEBET NOCH.

<font color="#660066"> -&#62; Professor Plato: There was a volcano eruption in Tambora in 1815 which had global implications. The ash and gasses caused the global atmosphere so much so that Europe and America called it &#34;the year without a summer&#34;. It killed so many crops that there was widespread famine.</font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; Professor Plato: These sorts of coin-like tokens are referred to as &#34;jetton&#34;, sort of like commemorative things. They were super popular from the 1200s-1700s</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): that was supposed to be ooc for the record</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato: if i recall correctly, there was a significant famine that year. which seems to be represented on the coin</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): That was a joke</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I now have Thomas Dolby stuck in my head</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The bookshelf is covered in loose leaf papers, many of which are strung together with twine or have nails stabbed through the corners and bent into a loop to hold them together. They all appear hand written in the same writing. There's also an ink pen, some very old pencils, and a black box.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yes, absolutely my fault!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Okay gentlemen, two options. We stay here and shuffle through all of this, or we take it with us and research it once we leave</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: This stuff creeps me out.  I don't like the idea of having it, but I like the idea of it falling into someone elses hands even less.  I think we have to take it.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I'm sure if we leave it it'll likely end up destroyed, I want to know what's happened down here.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Do you think...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Do you think we should sweep up what is left of that</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: thing.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato: can't leave it for the rats. better to take it with us</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Anything else that isn't to heavy to take with?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: I mean the altar is probably too much. Are you taking the whole bookshelf, or just the papers?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Just the papers for sure</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The &#34;altar&#34; is a large, heavy wooden table. It doesn't have legs, instead it just has a big block of wood about 2-3ft high, with the surface being expanded larger by about 6in on each side. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Carl would you like to try to collect the remains of Mr. Whoevertheheck, be my guest.</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Let's report back to Knott first. The house is NOT haunted, there is definitely a rat problem. The basement is in need of a hazmat team to clean and repair it</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: They'll find it, but there's nothing left of interest</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Let's give a dumb excuse for the bed</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Good thought Carl</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Let's go get your rope back</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Yes</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): The orphans</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): We have the record, right?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): And we got him to extend the deadline</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">With the report submitted, Mr Knott is pretty pleased with things. He's angry with news of the damage to the bed and window, but seems happier to hear that the square footage is larger than anticipated, so it balances out. He pays you your extra $25 in bonus fees for getting it done before Tuesday. </font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Take your time!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">In your down time, you have a few options for how you spend your time. Most of it is spent with professional matters, maintaining your Credit Rating. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Who still needs to do their taxes? :D I do!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Option 1: You can spend your downtime researching, allowing you to spend time reading and looking up adjacent tomes or translations for a book you've found. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Option 2: You can spend your time recovering your sanity. This typically involves spending time with the key parts to your backstory under Personal, though it can also involve seeing a professional or being institutionalized for a time. </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Option 3: You can spend your time pushing your advancement financially. You can roll to improve your Credit Rating, looking to obtain a higher income and thus more assets</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Option 3: You can spend your time pushing your advancement financially. You can roll to improve your Credit Rating, looking to obtain a higher income and thus more assets</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Clensed of the fire!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Option 5: You can take on a major project. This is one that would require months of work, such as building a secret room into your house or buying and setting up a new office. This requires a roll for Credit Rating, relating the financial investment required. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): So I currently have my CRx2 plus what we got from this job</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I'd like to take option 1 to research the objects we collected. The coin, the dagger, the black box and whatever's in it.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): But I'd also like to know what the other two would like to do before I make that decision</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): o.o</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: That's spooky</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I would like to ascend, yes</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I'll focus the black box and the stone for my first pick</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): There isn't any! :D</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Panera's You-Pick-2</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): :O</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I've never touched a horse so I don't know if they're real</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): i've never touched the sun</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): So by that same logic</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Oh heck he's right</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Horses have not touched me</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Brb grabbing food!</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): What are we stuck on? o.o</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Sentient...</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Roaches?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Star wtf?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Can see now</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: What is your first Downtime Activity</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Option 1: The box and the stone</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato: option 1: lober ivonis</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Liber*</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): ^Probably wrong</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Option 3: Expand handyperson business and hire an employee</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Hawu your gender neutral wording bringngs joy to my nonbinary heart</font><br />
<font color="#005500">Mogstew (Carl Handy): :)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Brb done eating, gotta bring dishes down!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): That was ooc</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The box itself is plain on the outside, but inscriptions are present on the inside. Carmen has to travel up to New York to talk to an expert in Greek history. Ida Steele meets with her, and gives her a rough translation of the text: &#34;From Tartarus to Elysium, from the Earth to the Heavens, may your Hermes protect you on your journey&#34; </font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: (More to come when Illy's back)</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I have returned! Thank you for waiting!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): &#60;3</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I actually kinda like my singing voice u.u</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Nice!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD I appreciate your lack of control!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Did Lanta also step away?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Rereading to see if I need any more info</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Or want</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Is that style of exposition okay with you, Illy? I didn't ask how you were looking into these, which I probably should have</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yes yes!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Please go on!!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The little black stone is odd. When rotating it, it seems to change shape subtly, which you only notice when you were holding it and turned to do something and felt it shift in your hand. It's always uncomfortably cold, as if it had been in a refrigerator. Did you want to take it to any particular experts?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Any geolegists in the area I can check with?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: [SKILL] Lang - Other - Latin (60%) [Hard success] (Spend 16 of your 65 luck to make it an Extreme Success.)</font> [d100 = 28]<br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): WHat??</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): For what?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): And then it dies</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): That's what I want to know!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen seeks out some geologists at Miskatonic University. Professor Julian Gallagher checks it out, but is quite puzzled by it. He can't identify the type of stone it is, though he is pretty sure it's crystalline rather than being a stone. It seems to have a hollow space within it, though it's empty given the sensation when shaken. </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica thanks the Professor and tries with any known spiritualists or antique experts</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Since it seems to be part of a set maybe it's something famous or important?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Antique experts are also pretty baffled by it. It's not something any of them have heard of before, not even with context of the box, though they do offer to buy it off of Carmen. Known mediums are even worse, the &#34;spiritualists&#34; keep saying it has something to do with Carmen's mother, or her future lover, or her dog (some are worse than the others). </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The professor has no problem getting started on his reading with the book. He's able to give it a proper read this time, though, and this is a bit more unnerving. Roll SAN. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I'm not going to bed any time soon :D</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Professor Plato: [ABILITY] Sanity Check (66%) [Extreme success]</font> [d100 = 13]<br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Nice roll! Sanity is probably always a good success</font><br />
<font color="#660066">'IllymetWaltsy' disconnected</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The professor makes it through about half of the notes in the book. It tells the story of the wizard Eibon and his strange travels, and he has to constantly reference different lores from the Greeks, the Egyptians, the Sumerians, and the people of Ur. (He gains 5 more Cthulhu Mythos)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The copy is hand written and incomplete, leaving most of the wizard's methods and stories incomplete. But one in particular is complete, and that's one where he calls upon the Opener of Ways. </font><br />
<font color="#660066">'IllymetWaltsy' connected</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Okay I'm back! :D</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): What did I miss?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Very weird!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The copy is hand written and incomplete, leaving most of the wizard's methods and stories incomplete. But one in particular is complete, and that's one where he calls upon the Opener of Ways. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): That's a decision!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): We're living and we're learning</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">This is a ritual which requires a circle to be etched in the ground and filled with water, and it gives an image of the diagram to sketch. It requires a &#34;pure blade of iron or copper, not of brass&#34;. The ritual itself, judging from how many times you have to repeat the incantation, probably requires an hour and a half at least to cast properly, though Eibon does it in half that time (and is said to be amazing for it). </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Is said to be amazing for it</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Fast chanter</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">In the story, the Opener of Ways appears and carries Eibon to the dreams of another where he may converse with the man, and then carries him back. Other worlds pass before his eyes, though, and the thought sends shivers up the professor's spione. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Carmen would try it</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: The Professor gains the spell &#34;Call the Opener of Ways&#34;. This spell will cost Magic Points to cast (you can see them near your hit points). If you don't have enough magic points, then it will draw from your Hit Points after your MP is expended. Casting such a spell will also take a toll on your Sanity (no roll to avoid). </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): In Bloodborne we call that gaining Insight</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD That's really funny!!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Can we do it as a group?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">When asking about with the professors, none of the main staff seem familiar with this topic (though you could work to recruit one). Eventually, you stumble across Professor Henry Armitage, the head librarian. The man seems positively spooked when it's brought up, and practically pleads with Professor Plato to end his investigations. &#34;Nothing good can come of this, it's better locked away in the restricted section.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">When dealing with the Opener of Ways, it does say that &#34;... with his forceful will, he directed the Opener of Ways to carry him&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Carmen would try it</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): But there are children</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">They're not a proper lot, but Carl's able to draw in the interest of several of the homeless and foster kids, teens and young adults. He lays the law down HARD, though, kicking out the troublemakers and getting the rules across with an even hand. The numbers naturally dwindle over time, always cycling in and out as they find the work not to their taste or as they find employment elsewhere. But even after four months, he's still got three regulars coming to him in addition to occasional new-comers. </font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Carmen pours over the notes of Walter Corbitt.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Gain 6 points of Cthulhu Mythos</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Got it!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">He mentions his house many times, which he refers to by the Anglo-French &#34;desmesne&#34; most of the time. Throughout, the notes mention times when he had to provide favors owed from when he claimed the house, and details (quite bitterly) what resources were spent. They're phrased in terms of either time spent, power granted for some purpose, or in gibberish-like names. They're always granted to abbreviations, not to full names. Example: &#34;broke another shell of the Opener in exchange for A.W.'s aid. One left.&#34; followed by scratchings of &#34;hate him&#34; or &#34;Sent the shambler to M.T., debt paid&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">He talks about his &#34;immortality&#34;. Not how he achieved it, but of its tragedy. He rambles about the neighborhood no longer providing enough &#34;fortune&#34; to feed his spells and curses &#34;Thomas&#34; for it. He seems to be overtaken by madness, many of the notes being incoherent scratches or scribbles for periods of time.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">He talks about his athame, the ritual dagger. He talks about sporadic sacrifices; cats, rats, and attempted human sacrifices to lift himself from his fugue. Even with his athame supposedly &#34;streamlining the transfer of blood to power&#34;, it's never enough.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica eyes the dagger warily </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">And throughout, he talks more and more about the rats. He workshops a way to use a medallion he procured to funnel &#34;the whispers of Khnum&#34;, which allowed him to control rats, bugs, and other vermin. He complains about its lack of finesse, but there's enough here to detail how to enact this yourself if you have the dagger and medallion.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica: As unluck would have it, she still has both...</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): In the office safe when she's not examining/studying it </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): This isn't instructions, it's vague notions of what could be done with these instruments?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Unlike the Book of Eibon, which seemed to have a breakdown on how to cast its spell, Carmen feels she'd have to put together the spell. It's something she could try to put together in the future, re-reading the book with the intent to learn more about the inner workings of Corbitt's magic. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Mhm mhm, that's what I though</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yeah</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl takes a trowel out to one of the local cemetaries and, when nobody is looking, buries the mason jar of ashes.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Carl Handy: </font> [2d6 = 11]<br />

<font color="#261A12">Carl trains his Spot Hidden through the most grueling of regimens: puzzle boxes and Where's Waldo books. Over the course of several months, he gets pretty into it, progressing from a mere novice to something of an amateur. It helps that the orphans are super into it as well, and it becomes sort of a game at his workplace</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): That's ADORABL</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato trains his ability to Dodge through a pretty active regimen of aerobics. He takes up a class for it, working on his flexibility and balance so he's better able to bend out of the way of otherworldly horrors. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I mean we're in this together now!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Carmen def is</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">It's a few months down the line before the three of you receive a little letter in the mail, an invitation to dinner with Nina Richards of &#34;The Society for the Exploration of the Unexplained&#34;. The letter reads:</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): :O!!!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">&#34;To Mr Carl Handy, Ms Carmen Santiago, and Professor ???? Plato (the first name is smudged out, unfortunately), We would like to cordially invite you to dine this weekend with us at the Willie Whitley Gallery to discuss interests which would certainly be to your interests. Please RSVP when available, -- Ms Nina Richards&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I absolutely intend to go</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Yes</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato: i suppose i could eat</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): YAY!!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Nina Richards is a middle-aged black woman with her hair pulled back into a floofy ponytail. She's seated at a table for four, and welcomes the group over. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): For context I plan on leaving the notes and the stone at my office, I'm planning on bringing the dagger with me </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): My art now</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Me :D</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The gallery itself is pretty full, they've got an art showing going on this weekend but also have an attached restaurant. Lots of private parties booking tables and tours, though Nina's only booked the table in the corner. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): :D</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: I'll give you a point of luck if you use the dagger to eat some of the horderves</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I'll take iit!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Okay, wait a sec then...</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Comes back???</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Okay then I'm not gonna</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Do that</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Harverd? Yale? </font><br />
<font color="#000066">Nina Richards: I'm Nina Richards, reporter for the Society of the Exploration of the Unexplained. We're a magazine and club founded by scientists and specialists of Harvard, Miskatonic University, Columbia, and other top universities. It's our self-appointed job to look into strange happenings around the country and figure out what's really causing them. </font><br />
<font color="#000066">Nina Richards: To that end, we received word that you, in the words of the advertisement, &#34;unhaunted&#34; a house. And I wanted to get some details on what you encountered and how you unhaunted it!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Nina holds out a newspaper article. &#34;NEWLY REFURBISHED, RECENTLY UNHAUNTED, CONTACT STEPHEN KNOTT FOR GREAT PRICES&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: A pleasure to meet you Ms. Richards. I'm Carmen Santamonica. And yes, we were involved in the, uh, unhaunting of Mr, Knott's residence.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: We're still trying to figure out what exactly that means.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Nina Richards: So am I! Sounds like we're in the same boat. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: But whatever we encountered in that house was defintely Unaxplained.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato: I would also like to know how you were able to find out how we were connected to the house</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Nina Richards pulls out a little notepad</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: C</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Nina Richards: We spoke to Mr Knott the other day and he said that you were the ones he hired to look into the house. Said that aside from some damage to the windows and discovering a hidden room in the basement, you did a pretty stellar job with confirming it was fine. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Sorry I really need a new keyboard &#62;:T</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Ffs I was hoping no one would notice that first one...</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Gdi</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Nina Richards: What sort of thing DID you encounter in that house? Was it a ghost? </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica Looks back and fourth between the professor and Carl</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato: there were a lot of rats</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: If you two don't mind, I'd like to see what she has to say about what we saw</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: Right. The rats.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: I wouldn't mind getting some more perspective on what happened in there. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I'll include that..</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato: feel free to share what happened. don't forget to include the flaming rats. so many rats. </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica recounts to the reporter in great detail the two days the three of them were researching and investigating the house of Mr. Knott</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Nina Richards: Flaming rats... that certainly does sound exciting! </font><br />
<font color="#880000">Nina Richards takes notes as Carmen goes on, letting her talk without much interruption</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Post human??</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Carmen Santamonica orders a drink</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The group huddles for a bit, and a few minutes later Nina returns from the wash to listen to their story. They go over their supernatural escapades; the research they'd looked up on the house, the man appearing for a moment in their midst and the Professor's mental break, the bed, the rat attack, the fire bucket, and culiminating with the secret room and the undead(?) man within. Nina remains fascinated the whole time.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Perfect</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">They leave out the Chapel, the Liber Ivonis, and the things they took from the house. </font><br />
<font color="#000066">Nina Richards: Fascinating! It's a shame he just dissolved into dust like that, that would've been headliner stories.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Nina Richards: We do like to publish our findings as well, is it okay if we publish your story here? </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I don't see why not. We would appreciate keeping out names and likenesses out of the story if possible</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Nina Richards: Oh of course! We always provide pseudonyms for people. I do also want to know, would any of you be interested in joining the Society? We can waive the yearly fee, provided you're active in the group. Most of the time it's just doing interviews like this, or going out to deliver books or do some readings. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): We can wait for Hawu to get back for this next part</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Though Carmen, is very much interested</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Do we still want to ask about Nina?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Carl do you want to take point on that?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Ms. Richards, we appreciate your interest.  I'm curious about your background, and what benefits you see for our joining the Society?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Nina Richards: Benefits include societal contacts, of course, we've got people all throughout America and even to Europe, South America, and Asia. If taking a trip, the Society covers expenses like lodging and food. I myself am a Miskatonic University alumni, I'm a freelancer with a few different magazines. Been with the society for a good ten years now, it's quite a lot of fun. Even if some of the stories are a bit out there, the people are fascinating.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: So you've only ever heard stories, never seen anything yourself?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Nina Richards: Well I haven't seen anything personally, but many of our members have. We find that it's the people with direct experience who have the most heart for the work, you know? </font><br />
<font color="#000066">Nina Richards: Though on the flip side, it is often the people who are the most touched, and they sometimes do wind up institutionalized before long</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: It seems silly to ask perhaps but I take it you are a believer in these phenemona, Ms Richards?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Nina Richards: I... believe that what you say is something you're convinced you saw, yes. I certainly don't think you're lying, any of you. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: We're *convnced* we saw? Odd way to word a &#34;no&#34;. *She adds with a small chuckle*</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Nina Richards: People connect dots, sometimes through religion and sometimes through science. But whether or not I believe doesn't matter, your viewpoint is important. </font><br />
<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): yes! :D</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Nina Richards takes a look at a sketch of the eye symbol</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Nina Richards: Hmmmm, nope, I'm afraid it doesn't ring a bell</font><br />

<font color="#005500">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Damn Carl </font><br />
<font color="#660066"> -&#62; Carl Handy: She seems genuinely like she has no idea. She's got a sort of flippant attitude, you're pretty sure she loves this stuff for the people but doesn't actually believe you saw anything. Probably the only reason she doesn't think you're murderers is that there was no body.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Do you sign up for the Society for the Exploration of the Unexplained?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carmen Santamonica: I'm interested. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Carl Handy: Yes, I am as well.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Professor Plato: i suppose it would be a good opportunity. i'm in</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Dinner concludes and Nina heads on her way. She has you fill out application forms, and gives the three of you a little calling card with the address for one of their offices in case you have any questions. </font><br />

Additionally, they included a copy of the letter they received from the original client.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">According the SEU's addendum, they expect this to take probably two days, one to get out there and assess the books and then another to head back. They're planning to book you for the weekend, though, getting you out there Friday and then heading back Sunday.</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">The gang gathers together to discuss it</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: we should reach out to the SEU and see if they know anything about Mr. Corn. It seems suspicious he wanted to donate books related to SEU's interests and is now unreachable. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Maybe something in the books that he wants to donate resulted in his disappearance</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Hopefully as a member hopefully they have some info about him and his background.</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Welcome to Fantasy Grounds</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">UI Scale changed to 200%</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">UI Scale changed to 120%</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: If you want to change the size of the UI, then do /scaleui 120 (or another number)</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">UI Scale changed to 130%</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ayji: okiee</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Hawu's playing a constructon guy, Illy's playing a private detective, and Star's playing a professor. Did you have a preference on your Occupation? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ayji: not really I need to look over them again </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: If you check on the right under Library-&#62;Modules, you'll have access to the CoC 7e Reference</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: You can use that to view a list of them</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Did you want to fully make a character, or do you want a pregen? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ayji: probably fully make a character so I can learn the rules a bit better</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Sure!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: So to roll things in Fantasy Grounds, it uses a physics engine. Pick up a die by click and dragging, and toss it into the chat window to roll</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Your character sheet will also have buttons on it that you can click to roll as well</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: I suppose we want your Occupation first, so let me know when you've got a general idea in mind? :3</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Also let me know if you want me on voice to walk you through any of this</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ayji: whatever you're comfortable with! ^^</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Nuh-uh, whatever YOU'RE comfortable with &#62;:C</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ayji: I'm thinking uh </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ayji: Probably Entertainer</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Oh ;3</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ayji: or Drifter</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: So I've Shared the two occupations with you here</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: The biggest difference between the two is the Occupation Skills you get, and the fact that Drifters have 0-5 Credit Rating, making them basically homeless</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ayji: So I see two blank spaces on Entertainer listing interpersonal skills. I'm assuming those are essentially cross occupation skills that I can choose? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: On Entertainer, you can pick any two Interpersonal Skills (Charm, Persuade, Intimidate, or Fast Talk). Charm lets you convince someone by being nice and pleasant, Persuade through logic, Intimidation through threats, and Fast Talk through bamboozlement</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Fast Talk often lets you get away with the  most, but they realize they've been bamboozled at some point in the future</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Drifter gets one, Entertainer gets two</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: The remaining two blank spots are for any skills you want, except for Credit Rating and Cthulhu Mythos</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ayji: okie I think I&#34;ll go entertainer then </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Okay! :D</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">GM: Click on the Player-&#62;Characters button on the right hand side. You should see a character there with your name on it, do you see it?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Click on the Player-&#62;Characters button on the right hand side. You should see a character there with your name on it, do you see it?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: found it</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: :D</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: We'll use this as your character</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">To roll your stats, left click a d6 to pick it up. Then, right click twice to duplicate it twice. Take those 3d6 and throw them into the chat window</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Aya c:: </font> [3d6 = 14]<br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: i c i c </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">You begin with 3d6x5 STR, so in your case you begin with 70 STR</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: then does it go down and to the right or to the right and down? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The 70 represents your total Strength. In order to succeed with a Strength Check, you must roll under your Strength. Double click the 70 to roll a Strength Check</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Aya c:: [ABILITY] Strength Check (70%) [Regular success]</font> [d100 = 55]<br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: ah okie it kinda works like uh</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: dark heresey </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Exactly!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some things are more difficult than others, like bursting through a barricaded door vs a normal door. The 35 represents the threshold for this &#34;Hard Success&#34; (1/2 your STR), and the 14 represents the threshold for an &#34;Extreme Success&#34; (1/5 of your STR)</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: ah okie </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roll another 3d6 for your CON</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Aya c:: </font> [3d6 = 8]<br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: 40 CON lol</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: not great!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roll 2d6 for your SIZ and add two</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">*add six</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Aya c:: </font> [2d6 = 5]<br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: SIZ represetns your size, a combination of both height and weight. It can manifest in whichever combination you want. Your Size is 55.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">SIZ represetns your size, a combination of both height and weight. It can manifest in whichever combination you want. Your Size is 55.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roll 3d6 for your DEX</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Aya c:: </font> [3d6 = 13]<br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: 65!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Roll 3d6 for your APP. Appearance represents both physical attractiveness and personality, in whichever way you want it to manifest</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Aya c:: </font> [3d6 = 7]<br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: OH NO</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: yeah that seems right</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: It's the opposite!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">INT represents intelligence, which is your quick-wittedness. Roll 2d6+6 for that</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: no no this is pretty average for me rolling a new character for the first time </font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Aya c:: </font> [2d6 = 5]<br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: 45</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">POW is your Power, your force of will and how much mental vitality you have. Roll 3d6 for that. </font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Aya c:: </font> [3d6 = 9]<br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">EDU represents book learning and formal education, stuff that's good on Jeopardy. Roll 2d6+6 for that</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Aya c:: </font> [2d6 = 3]<br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: You'd make Star proud</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: I should roll another 45</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Yup lol</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: er, well, it's another 45 for EDU there </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: yeah lol </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">And finally, roll 3d6 for your LUCK stat</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Aya c:: </font> [3d6 = 9]<br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: lmao</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Luck is unique. Luck is used both for determining targets for monsters (sometimes) and for determining things that you don't really have any control over.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can find the stat under the normal stats, to the far right</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any time you make a roll, you can permanently reduce your LUCK by an amount to improve your roll by that much. This can turn a failure into a success</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">As an alternative, any non-combat roll can be Pushed. If you Push a roll then you get a free reroll! However, if you fail a Pushed roll, then it counts as a Complication, which I can use to make bad things happen to you. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Your stats are, uh, noticeably below what the others have </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Would you like a bit of a boost? lol</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: If that would be necessary otherwise I don't mind rolling with it and dying if it comes to that </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: I can work with this otherwise </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Death may come for you anyways, but if you'd like you can distribute 90 points among your stats (maximum of 80 in any single skill)</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Entertainers gain a number of Occupation Skill Points equal to twice their EDU plus twice their APP, so you'll want higher values in those. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: are my skills that much noticeable lower than everyone elses ;w; </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: noticeably*</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: lol if you sum theirs up, they're at 480, 490, and 510 I think. You're at 400</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: They're all playing pregens, though</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: ahhh</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: I suppose that is a bit lower then</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: and that app and edu score is a pretty big hinderance</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: I'm not gonna have my friend Aya start off on the back foot just because of luck &#62;:c</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: I'm gonna have you die fair and square by rolling like garbage!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: &#60;3</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: Thats good!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: lol</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: okie</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: I added 45 points</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: You get 45 more :3</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: okie</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: I added 70 points total. I don't mind being at a slight disadvantage </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: makes me think more</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Okidoki!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your secondary characteristics are below and to the right of your main attributes</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hit Points are how many hit points you have. 0 is dying. If you take 5 or more at once, you suffer a Major Wound and have additional debuffs (broken leg, maimed hand, etc)</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sanity is how mentally sound you are. Whenever you spot something supernatural, you'll roll vs your Sanity to avoid losing your cool and/or going insane</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Magic you don't gotta worry about yet</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">DB is a Damage Bonus for your size and strength, which is added to melee attacks. This is represented by your Build. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Dodge we'll talk about in a bit</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pop over to Skills here, and click the blue pencil toward the top</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: okie!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">As an Entertainer, you have Art/Craft (Acting), Disguise, Listen, and Psychology as Occupation Skills. (Psychology is Sense Motive)</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Which two Interpersonal Skills do you want to be Occupation Skills? Charm, Fast Talk, Intimidate, or Persuade?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Also, you may choose any two other skills to have in terms of class skills</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: Interpersonal I'll probably do Charm and persuade</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: Then probably stealth and uh</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Melee attacks in this are opposed rolls. When attacked, the defender can opt to Dodge or Fight Back. If they Dodge, they only have to roll an equal level of success to the attack roll to dodge it. If they Fight Back, they have to roll one level higher, but if they win then they deal damage. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: hmm</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Oh, up at the top there's five blue options. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ln is for selecting secondary languages. Ar for arts. Ft for fighting skills (melee). Sc for science skills. And Fr for firearm skills</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: What kind of entertainer were you?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: probably like a vaudville assistant. The girl that gets tied to the spinning wheel and or ties crowd participants to the wheel </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: circus performer</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Pretty c:</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: actually</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: I think I'll do first aid </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Sure! :D</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Each skill starts off with a Base score. For example, Operate Heavy Machinery starts at only a 1% level of success, but you can increase that on a 1:1 basis with your 220 Occupation Points. In contrast, First Aid starts at 30% and you can do the same. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">You also have 110 Personal Interest points that can be spent on anything you want</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd recommend to try and have at least three skills above 50% by the end of this, if not more. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: I'd recommend to try and have at least three skills above 50% by the end of this, if not more. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: You can only increase Credit Rating to 60 at max, and cannot put points into Cthulhu Mythos, but other than that it's up to you :3</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: okie</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: It's worth noting for reference that First Aid is good for stabilizing, but those injuries do need medical professionals, so you'll keep them alive as they get to a hospital</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you have 110 points to spend on any skills you want </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: okie dokie!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perfect! Click the blue pen again to turn off Edit mode and we've got your skills set up</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any time you succeed in a skill check, check off the box next to it. You have a chance at improving that skill in between adventures</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: ooo</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Click on Inventory next</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Click on Inventory next</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">In the bottom right is your Wealth. Spending Level means that you can buy anything worth under $10 and not have to record spending for it. Cash represents how much money you have on your person at any given time. And Assets represent the value of your belongings in general, stuff you could sell off for cash if you need. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">However, in general, you cna start off with any items in your inventory that you generally would have. I leave that to your discretion and reserve the right to reject it if you say you have 50 war hounds </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: lol</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Anything you *don't* put in there, you can make a Luck roll to retroactively have. As long as it's reasonable. A Luck check to see if you remembered to bring a flashlight or some rope or handcuffs</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: funnily enough I was going to say rope and handcuffs but like entertainment handcuffs so ones with a quick release </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: You can go with whatever your character might have on them. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: can I just add that under uh</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: the top section?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Yup!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your character is a member of the Society for the Exploration of the Unexplained, a club based in Boston which has a little magazine. The rest of the group just joined it and were sent out to this little town in the country, Gamwell, to collect a donation of books. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: do you want me to include everything I'd consider basic first aid individually or can I just put down like first aid kit</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: You can just do &#34;First Aid Kit&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: okie dokie</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Anything reasonable that's in there is just automatically in there</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Keep in mind this is the 1920s. Also, $1 in the 1920s is about $10 in today's money</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">For now, click over to the Personal tab</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are four main parts to your character: their ideology/beliefs, significant people (past or present), meaningful locations, and treasured possessions. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: This is a list of Ideologies to roll on if you want, or you can pick one, or make one up for yourself</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: One each for Meaningful Locations and Treasured Possessions</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: And two for Significant People</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: You can roll or pick an option for each to help flesh out your character. These bonds help define your connection to Humanity, and are used to recover from the supernatural in between adventures</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: okie</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: You should also pick a name</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: the hardest part</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">What you know: You've been sent out to this little town, Gamwell, to take stock of a bunch of books that the archeologist Arthur Cornthwaite is donating to the Society (SEU). He had them all delivered to their combined church/library, and you've been cataloguing them for the last day or two as more help arrives to transport them back to Boston. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: Im gonna roll on these I think </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: All good :D</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Aya c:: [TABLE] 2. Ideology/Beliefs = </font> [d10 = 4]<br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">A belief in fate (e.g. karma, the class system, superstitious).</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: That makes sense actually </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: :D</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: spends too much time with the card reader</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Ehehehehehe</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: You can add a tarot deck to your inventory if you want</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: hmmm</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: I'm gonnan roll on significant people but I have an idea in mind so I might change it if I'm not a fan of the results if you're okie with that</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Absolutely!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: The tables are here for inspiration and assistance only</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Aya c:: [TABLE] 3a. Significant People - 1 = </font> [d10 = 2]<br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Grandparent (e.g. maternal grandmother, paternal grandfather).</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Aya c:: [TABLE] 3b. Significant People - 2 = </font> [d10 = 7]<br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">You idolize them.&#10;(e.g. for their fame, their beauty, their work).</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: yeah going with my idea</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: lol</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: spent a little too much time with the card reader :3</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: its the circus I'm sure that was allowed there in the 20s</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Oh 100%, and also I don't like playing up the homophobia and racism of the 1920s so you won't find a lot of that in my sessions</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: As far as I'm concerned, 60% of 1920s US was lesbians</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: so true</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: doesn't bother me either way if people do though my pathfinder campaign I'm in takes place in the nazi devil worshipper country and I'm playing essentially a native american so </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: I know how to play around it and can usually tell when people are getting weird about it </font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Aya c:: [TABLE] 4. Meaningful Locations = </font> [d10 = 5]<br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">A place for socializing (e.g. gentlemen's club, local bar, uncle's house).</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: lmao these dice</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: lesbians in the gentlemans club</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: hmmm</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: lesbian gentlemen, all in suits and ties</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: ok but women in suits </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: I love the new Bounty outfit ;A;</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: It's so great</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: it iiis</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: I just crafted a set of that for caur </font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Aya c:: [TABLE] 5. Treasured Possessions = </font> [d10 = 1]<br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">An item connected with your highest skill (e.g. expensive suit, false ID, brass knuckles).</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: I forgot what my highest skill is</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: I think its charm</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Yup!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: hmmm that could be interesting but I think I'll go with the tarot deck</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aya c:: or does that differ from regular inventory</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: It can or it could not, it's up to you. You could have a normal tarot deck you got in the store, and leave your Treasured Possession (a vintage one) back at home</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: She'd probably carry it with her </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: so how we doin age? just deciding or rolling</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Just deciding, though if you're old-old then you get some stat adjustments</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: height and weight? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Also up to you! </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: okie colleges? </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: You may want to put none, or put your circus name</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: yeah I put none</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: You were born in Romania; did you want to have points in Romainian for free or did you learn English about the same time?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: and put residence as circus</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I wouldn't mind having points in romanian </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Is Romanian her first or second language?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: first language</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: probably would have immigrated at a young age but like</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: 12 young age</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Fully fluent in English, though? Albiet with an accent she often over-emphasizes?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Fluent in english but yeah heavily accented </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Picked up by a circus as a teenager that specifically helps immigrant families find a place to stay </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: I'll give you equal ranks in each, but you're really more fluent in Romanian. We'll say that the circus itself largely speaks the language</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: yeah</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I think that makes sense</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I'd say she spent most of her life in the US with the circus</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: so probably picked up around like 14/15</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: :D</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: What does she know about her parents? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: She knew them well and has a good relationship with them. Moved to the US to seek work in entertainment (silent movies!) </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Yaaaay! </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Who's her partner? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: They wanted to act, she wanted to entertain crowds so they sent her along with a circus</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: And it's gone wonderfully :3</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: What lead her to joining the SEU?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Her partner is the Tarot card reader Yvonne. An Irish girl that was dropped off at the circus. Around the same age as her maybe a few years older</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: She joined the SEU after overhearing a conversation from some members that had attended a show in Phiadelphia</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Perfect! Did you have any questions?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: hmmm I don't think so!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Should I fill out these phobias traits etc as well?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Nope</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Traits if you want</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Phobias, Injuries, Scars, and Strange Encounters I'll fill out</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Though if you want to fill out anything there, you may </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: The only requirement is that Strange Encounters have to be something that have plausible deniability </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I'll let you pick those then :3</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: You do gotta put in your personal description, and check for a profile pic</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Oh, also, are there any phobias or topics you don't want present in anything? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I'm ok with anything</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Spiders, cannibalism, babies, etc?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Cannibalistic baby spider monsters?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: as long as there aren't pictures of spiders</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I will be okie</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: ... what about spider derivatives?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: like realistic spiders I should say. Fake spiders I can handle</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Okay! I'll avoid pics of them, and probably avoid going too heavily into them</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Like if you sent me a picture of a tarantula I'd probably freak out </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: lol no problem xD</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: but if you sent me a dnd lolth spider monster thing I'd probably be ok </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: What about one of those sexy drider ladies?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I do like quelaag from dark souls </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: ehehehehe</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: We'll leave it to artistic representations for them, and also not go too heavy on the spooders</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Oh, does Lillian carry any weapons with her?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: probably just a knife</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: like one of those ones you throw at spinning piece of wood you've tied someone too </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: so a bigger knife</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: but still a knife</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Crocodile Dundee?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: yeah closer to a dundee</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: :D</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Sounds good</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Uh, you do only have a 20 in Throw though. Did you want to tweak your skills?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: probably not a bad idea</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: that probably makes more sense</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I figure shes more of a talker than a fighter. She was the one getting knives thrown at her more than throwing them</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: okie</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I think I have that filled out </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: where are hte pictures at? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: or is it import</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: :D</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Pics can be imported, or if you click the portrait icon you can selet them from a little adial drop down menu</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: You can shoot one to me if you want me to use it for you</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: it keeps picking at random!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: hmm</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: I suspet</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: That this isn't what you're supposed to look like</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: yeah I don't think so </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: That works</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Much better lol</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: So pretty &#60;3</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: heee</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Anything else we need to do? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: I don't think so!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Additional gear if you have any, </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: but you can just write that down and add it tomorrow as you need it</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: I'll shoot you more stuff tonight about Gamwell just so you already have it</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: okie dokie!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Thanks for walking me through this :3</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Of course!!!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: It's not too bad, but it does take a hot minute sometimes</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: always does </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: ooo just in time raids start in less than 30 minutes</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: &#60;3</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">GM: Tomorrow night!</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: As a reminder, if you want to whisper someone, you can do &#34;/w [name] to reach them, or &#34;/w gm&#34; to reach me. You can use tab to autocomplete a name once you start it</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Carl is driving over in his truck, yeah? </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Mogstew (Carl Handy): Yes</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cityscape slowly gives way to countryside as the group travels out from Boston toward the sleepy little town of Gamwell. Surrounded by little more than farms, the town's only ever really used by the locals or as a quick pitstop for travellers. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: I wanted to tell you both, I think we need to be careful about the woman that inducted us into the society.  I'm pretty sure that if we had told her the more...gruesome details of what happened we would all be sitting in a police department right now.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Mogstew (Carl Handy): This is based on my extreme success psychoanalysis of her</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Hmm, you might be right about that Carl.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: SEU: The Society for the Exploration of the Unexplained</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The road traveling through the town is the only one of note. Along it, a general store boasts the only filling station for miles. There's a small series of buildings along one side of the road, including &#34;Dodge, Dodge, and Dodge&#34;, &#34;The Gamwell Gazette&#34;, and &#34;PO LICE&#34;. The most stand-out building is the small chapel at the far end of town, a whitewashed stone building. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: (They sell wrenches</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Also, the kerning in &#34;police&#34; is canon</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): If you can dodge, ball</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The letter from the Socieity of the Exploration of Unexplained had mentioned that the books had been transferred from Cornthwaite's mansion to the local church, and that they had someone there already who'd been categorizing them. </font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: Your work in organizing and taking note of the books has been fruitful. However, you've got a list of books that the SEU was really looking forward to, and several of them are missing.</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: Of note - De Occulta Philosophia, The Missing People: The Tribe that the Jungle Swallowed, The Antiquities of Mexico, Secret Teachings of All Ages, and The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): ok</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">You can see a beaten down space between the church and the filling station which likely is the site for weekly markets</font><br />

<font color="#FFE6AB">Walter Dodge: Ah, yes, um... it's quite the predicament</font><br />

<font color="#FFE6AB">Herbert Dodge: Well we spoke with him while collecting the books as well over the weekend</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Reginald Dodge: I called on him earlier this week, but didn't hear anything. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Anything out of the ordinary with his demenour last you spoke with him? Nervousness? Fatigue? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">It is currently Friday afternoon, September 18th 1925</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: And he gave no indication to the three of you that he would be leaving?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Odd.</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Herbert Dodge: None at all, did he talk to you?</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Thank you for your input, ma'am. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Anyone we could talk to in town who would know a bit more about Mr. Cornthwaite's day to day activities? Maybe even have seen him in the time between the three of you were able to meet?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Walter Dodge: I'm not sure. He was very nervous, he hasn't been out of his house a lot for the last couple of months</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr Arthur Cornthwaite is someone you've all heard of in passing. He's an archeologist who's specialty includes the ancient peoples of South America. He's in his 40s, and has made several contributions to the field over the course of he last twenty years. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Reginald Dodge: Oh most definitely, it was quite obvious that something did not go well</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Sorry for interjecting but was there anything that happened prior to when his behavior began to change? Anything that sticks out as unusual? </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Probably whatever happend during his time out   </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Walter Dodge: Nothing specific, he was fine when he left on his trip</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Walter Dodge: He went to South America, I believe</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Herbert Dodge: Yes, an expedition down there. I'm not sure what he was searching for, but it was when he came back that he became much more reclusive</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Did he say where he was going in south america? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The brothers look at each other, exchanging maybe a dozen or two glances before looking back at the group</font><br />

<font color="#FFE6AB">Walter Dodge: It should have the receipts and all the information you could want</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">GM: Yup! </font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): There's a lot to keep track of as a GM!!</font><br />

<font color="#FFE6AB">Reginald Dodge: Unfortunately, we don't have much information on his day-to-day spendings. Mr Cornthwaite preferred to handle his domestic staff personally, we just issued him a stipend. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Walter Dodge: I found the newspaper from earlier this week, if that's of any help!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): When we're not talking to the three stooges here I'll get to that</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: do you three work in this town soley for Mr. Cornwaite?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Herbert Dodge: Well, not sole reason. We serve the entire county out here. There's a lot of farm land, wills, legal disputes, and other things we take care of. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">From a glance, you'd estimate that maybe 30% of their space here is devoted to stuff that Cornthwaite's done. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looking through his records of his most recent trip, Carl notices something weird. The trip down to Peru is highly detailed, with people and supplies and numbers and addresses. But the trip back has a lot of voided payments and refunds. It looks like his return two months ago really only paid for the return passage for one person. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Aya you can totally interrupt to send your intro at any time I think</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Reginald Dodge (to Lillian): You won't have too much luck finding more details on his personal staff, either. He didn't like hiring people from around here, preferred &#34;proper staff&#34; as he called them. I'm afraid we don't have any records on who, exactly, they'd be at his estate.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Apologies for not introducing myself t you three earlier. My name is Lillian. Lillian Lovell! Under most circumstances I perform with the circus but with the season winding down we're not on tour currently. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Lillians English comes off as fairly fluent, but her accent is clearly originating from somewhere in eastern Europe </font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carl Handy looks around a bit flustered and walks over to Lillian.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Sorry this is all a bit awkward, I'm Carl Handy.</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carl Handy extends a hand for a firm handshake.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: A... performer! Well, pleasure to meet you Ms. Lovell. </font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica tips her hat</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Lillian Lovell Shakes Carls hand and gives a slight bow to Carmen. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Pleasure is all mine!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's one more thing that sticks out among the receipts, and that's on one of the most recent orders. The professor picks up a small slip of typed paper which has a receipt for an entire truck of salt on it; unsigned, indicating it hasn't been paid for yet. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Now that we've been properly introduced...</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carl Handy turns towards the lawyers.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Sirs, you are all clearly pretty upset about Mr. Cornthwaite being missing.  Beyond being concerned for your acquaintance, and client, is there something else that has you on edge about all this?  You reached out to the SEU...are there perhaps unusual phenomenon that you may not entirely feel comfortable discussing in normal company? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The receipt is local, from a Boston company, and is dated as having arrived Tuesday, September 15th, just a few days ago. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): smiles and flips to a new page in her notepad</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica smiles and flips to a new page in her notepad</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Very good way to present that Hawu</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Walter Dodge: It's really just the well-being of our esteemed customer that has us worried. If you can confirm his well being and whereabouts, that would be very appreciated.</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Herbert Dodge: We can give you the keys to his estate if you'd like to investigate, we just ask that no damage be done to the property </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: We will do our utmost to make sure no damage comes to the house or it's contents.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Is there anyone else you would advise we follow up with? I would rather not cause any unncessary alarm if we are going to his estate</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Reginald Dodge: As far as I'm aware, he had a working relationship with the SEU. It's why he felt safe donating his library to you. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Walter Dodge: We figured you'd have a more pure motive to investigate a friendly face than some unaffiliated cityfolk</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Walter Dodge (to Lillian): Well you may want to check with the Sheriff before heading down, but otherwise no.</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Herbert Dodge: The houses are far enough apart that you can't really see one from another</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: I don't mean to be indelicate, but did he say why he wanted to donate this library now of all times?  Was Mr. Cornthwaite ill or...perhaps had some cause to think his time was running short?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Reginald Dodge: No, not ill. But Mr Cornthwaite has always been a great philanthropist, donating large sums to both the community and those in need. I'm sure it was something to do with that!</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Walter Dodge: He did seem really relieved to have the sale go through, though. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: Also, do you know if the contents of the library were recently aqcuired? perhaps on his recent trip?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Herbert Dodge: No, not at all. He didn't even make it back with his suitcase. It was quite an ordeal. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The receipts do seem to confirm this, he definitely didn't ship back a lot of stuff with him. It was just payment for his personal voyage</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Do the three of you know what exactly he *did* bring back with him?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Dodge, Dodge, &#38; Dodge: No</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Sorry, you mentioned being relieved with a sale?   What sale?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Walter Dodge: I apologize, I meant the donation. Mr Cornthwaite is even covering the expenses for transporting his books back out to Boston. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: When Mr. Cornthwaite gave you the instructions for the transfer of the library, were there any items in particular he was especially specific about?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Is there anyone else around here he would confide in. Did he have a good relationship with the priest in town?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Reginald Dodge: No, not particularly</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): There records on staff will probably be at his estate</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): is what we were told</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Correct</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Reginald Dodge: When I, uh, called on him earlier this week, nobody answered. So I think he may have dismissed his staff for his... his vacation. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I really am ;n;</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Like I'm trying to play Carmen as a tough detective but I'm trying to not be MEAN &#62;.&#60;</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Is there anything else you can think of that may help us before we leave? We'd really love to help find him but we really need more info and you've already been so helpful. What's a little more hm? </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: You CAN die, but I'll tell you now that you probably wouldn't unless you were injured and out of magic points</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Lillian Lovell Moves up to reginald and sways enticingly in front of him looking up at him with a pleading look</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Got em</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Lillian Lovell Leans in to whisper in his ear</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Reginald Dodge: Ah, uh, no. I just... well, I went to his estate. And uh, I called in to see if he was there. And when I opened the door it just... it just swung open slowly, but nobody responded. And there was just silence. Usually he's there, and uh he'll come down to talk, but nobody responded at all, neither him nor any of his servents. Which is why we think he went on vacation, because he clearly let his servents go as well, so I'm sure things are fine but we don't actually have the records I think he normally keeps them upstairs in his study. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: His studdy...</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: Anything else you'd like to share sir? You can tell me it'll be our little secret</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica flips her notebook closed</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: He seems to be putting his best effort to seem helpful, but it doesn't seem like he even entered the house. That's about all he knows.</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Carl, Plato, though we were sent on a simple pick-up, I'd like to investigate Mr. Conthwaite's disappearance. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Ms. Lillian, as a member of the organization, I'd like to extend an invitation to join us</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Perfect! I was just about to ask if I could join you. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Wonderful. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Mr. Dodge, Mr. Dodge... Mr. Dodge. Thank you for your cooperation. Would you like to be updated of any developments?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I'll explain on the way out</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Walter Dodge: Absolutely! And please, do not damage the property if you can avoid it. Do take care. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Good day, gentlemen. We'll be in touch once we've made any headway.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): I'd like to at least talk to the sheriff</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): So we don't get shot for going into this guys estate</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Lanta??</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Walter Dodge: Calendar</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Carmen Santamonica: Did I miss a thing? ;A;</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Carmen Santamonica: Not sure! I did say I was gettin up to grab dinner!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The group exits the little law firm, looking around this nice warm September day. Free to travel wherever they want!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: That was some trick back there Lillian.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: You learn a lot in the circus </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: A practiced skill, I'm sure.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: But it was very well done</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: shall we go see if the sheriff is also fond of the circus?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Lillian, I believe you were going to fill us on on how you got here? How about we walk and talk?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I appreciate that. Now I believe it was asked earlier why I was here. I had received a request to investigate Cornthwaites disappearance. As I'm sure you've guessed I'm also a member of the SEU. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Originally we were here to just pick up his books for the libaray.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: But the way he described the empty house, peiqued(sp??) my interest. Let's start at the Sheriff's office.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Yes! It appears that a few of the books the SEU wants did not make their way to their collection</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): is it piequed?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: piqued I think</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): frik</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): all good!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I agree lets check in with the sheriff. Can you three tell me how you ended up working together? I normally work solo when they send me out</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: and you are! Missing books is indeed why I was sent here</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Okay so, we start at the sheriff's office, I let them know I'm a private eye and here to help with the disappearance on request of his attorneys</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: That will prevent any unhappy encounters with local law enfourcement</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: (To clarify, the SEU is accepting Cornthwaite's collection. They know about several books he has, and wanted to make sure those books make it to them. Most of those books are sitting in boxes in the church right now, but there are a few missing from there that are theoretically still in the house.) </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Ty for the clarity</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: to answer your question on how we know each other. we worked on a haunted house case together, and joined the SEU afterwards</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I mean we should catch Lillian up with what happoned in season 1, right?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Do whateva you want and is easier for you!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: They were a cheap option for him to hire to &#34;prove&#34; his house wasn't haunted</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): No they weren't flaming</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Mostly</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): And yes the holy water was actually useful. As water</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I was gonna light it on fire</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): But the body said no</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): But then I dropped the lighter on it anyway</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): It was a little stressfull, but we blasted it</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Fire and force did seem to work against the undead... lich.... guy..... thing</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: quite the journey you three have been on </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: It was... eye opening to say the least</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Have you ever experienced something like that, Ms. Lovell?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Can't say I have! This kind of work of gathering artifacts or books seems to be what I do usually. Though nothing has truly been exciting. Very administrative almost </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: I still don't have an explination for much of what we saw that night. I'm hoping joining this SEU will give some answers. If not, hopefully some better questions. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I joined after overhearing a few circus attendees who happened to be part of the organization discussing the existence of old folk creatures from my home country. I... convinced them to talk to me about what they were talking about and ended up here!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Nothing unsavory but people do tend to spill the beans when you flaunt a little in their personal space!</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica shrugs, but nods.</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Lillian Lovell Tilts her head quizzically at the professor </font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I exist</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sheriff is typing up a report as the investigators enter the little office. It's one of those combination office/jail buildings, with the cage sitting to the right of the sheriff's desk. The name tag on his desk says &#34;Sheriff William Whitford&#34;. He's a good looking, solidly built man. He's got a collar and a tie, with a dark jacket that his sheriff's badge is attached to. His hair is cut short, oiled in place, and shot through with grey. He glances up as you enter. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Then keep goin there yeh</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: Well howdy there, how can I help y'all?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Time of day check</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Mogstew (Carl Handy): vibe check</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): distracted by vibes</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Carmen Santamonica: Love u &#60;3</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Good afternoon Sheriff. My name is Carmen Santamonica, I'm a private investigator with the SEU, here on behalf of Walter, Herbert and Reginald Dodge. We're looking into the disappearance of Mr. Cornthwaite.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: We'll be visiting his place of residence and, with the permission of the Dodges, be entering his home. We wanted to check in with you first to make sure there weren't any complications or issues.</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: Hmm? It isn't much of a disappearance. I've already been down there once to have a look around, and there's no indication of any breaking or entering. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: That's a good start. We're hoping we don't find much else ourselves.</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: The man's probably taken a much needed vacation. God knows he's earned it. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: As long as y'all don't do anything illegal, you'll have nothing to fear from me</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: Make sure you keep it in the line. No fires or anything, and no thieving, y'hear? </font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Sheriff Whitford squints at the group</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: Speaking of which, where were y'all last night? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: That seems like a rather odd lead in. Why do you ask? </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: Let me ask the questions</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: ...Myself and the two men with us only got into town just this morning.</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: I'm assuming I arrived shortly before they did</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: You arrived the other day, the pastor and his wife gave you a place to stay last night. You spent all night with them and the books</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I've been here a day or so longer than they have. The pastor let me stay with them and I spent most of my time going over their books. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: Hmmm, I see</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: Carry on, then</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Sheriff Whitford waves at the group as he resumes typing up his report</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Ah yes, speaking of books. There are a few of Mr Cornthwate's books that were slotted for donation to the SEU that weren't handed over to the church. We'll also be trying to locate them during the invesigation.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: &#34;Who could have done such a thing&#34; says Carl as he does such a thing</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Sir I don't mean to intrude on official police work but asking us to not start fires and then asking where we were sounds like it may be of concern. Should we be aware of anything going on? </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: If he gave the okay then you should be safe. No doubt we can check with him when he's back, though</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Excuse me, Sherriff- I take it there was a fire incident?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: Nothing bad with regards to fires, no. Just general precautions</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): He's getting pressed</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Quick ask more pointed questions</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: As for other things... Seb Watkins lost a horse last night. It's a valuable animal, and it had to have been taken at some point last night because of the heavy dew this morning </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: Any tracks would've been spotted </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: The horse kidnapped Cornthwaite</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: We'll keep an eye out for any wayward horses. Thanks for... all your help Sheriff.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Nothing, she means thanks for nothing</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): The horse was also abducted by aliens just like Cornthwate and all his staff.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Calling it now</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Gotta get the books back from them aliens</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The group heads back outside, the directions to Cornthwaite's estate in hand. It's not too far, maybe a 30min walk or a 5min drive. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: (POLL) Check out the newspaper?</font><br />

He's in a bright red and green checked suit, is clean shaven, and has a panama hat covering thick chestnut hair. </font><br />

<font color="#FFE6AB">Sam Artemis: He's out now, unfortunately. He'd love to talk about it. I can let you browse through the old archives if you want to look for more stuff specifically, or I can answer questions if you have any</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sam Artemis: Didn't know the man personally, though</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I know he's wealthy but is running a story on him being gone a few days something that would normally get run in the paper? </font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">The group heads back next door to the Sheriff's office, and Sheriff Whitford raises an eyebrow at the group. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: Well, long time no see. What brings you back?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: &#62;:c</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Star explodes</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): OMG</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): STAR NOO</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Just wanted to  ask another question before we investigate the mansion further. That place seems to have a rather gruesome history. Do you remember anything about what happened there? </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Make Psychology checks</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Carl Handy: [SKILL] Psychology (10%) [Fail] (Spend 15 of your 48 luck to succeed.)</font> [d100 = 25]<br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">A shadow seems to go over the man's expression as he leans forward, frowning. He's got a haunted look in his expression. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: I remember every night. Arthur Curwen killed his family</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica takes the seat in front of the man.</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: He got away back then, but I hope he's still aliveI hope he's still alive somewhere, because I'm looking forward to shooting the bastard down like the dog that he is. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: So Curwen was never found? No leads?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: None. He didn't take his horse, so he had to have traveled on foot, but we've heard nothing of him</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Im sorry to make you recall this again sir but do you remember anything from that night that stood out as unusual for the given situation? Any strange behavior from Curwen before that night or anything he may have left behind? </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Sheriff Whitford: Nothing that I remember, he was a recluse by nature. As for what he left behind, you can find that over in the cemetary</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): yeah </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): It took Star just a second, but he got there</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): I feel nothing bad could come from this</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The flowers that the pastor's wife put out the other day are making a little more sense to Lillian</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Anything else I can recall from my time with the pastor and his wife</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Heh</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thinking back, Lillian recalls something else that the pastor had mentioned in passing: &#34;Poor man's been struggling with his guilt for months now.&#34; When pressed on this, he seemed a bit sheepish and said he couldn't say anything more, shouldn't have said that much. What's told in confession is intended to be in confidence, after all. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: (This cropping up when they'd been talking about Cornthwaite</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Was loading in! :D</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Last time, our group of investigators arrived in the little town of Gamwell. They discussed details on the books with the lawyers, about local going-ons with the sheriff, and about events with the newspapers. Once finding out about the old murders, the group revisited the Sheriff and found that it was he who found the massacre 30 years ago. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The group's got almost all of the books, but a few special interest books don't appear to be present in those brought to the church for donation. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Oh right! He's been here for a long time omg...</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Dad's got good(ish) hearing!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">These books are: De Occulta Philosophia, The Missing People: The Tribe that the Jungle Swallowed, The Antiquities of Mexico, Secret Teachings of All Ages, and The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: Oh, hello again, Lillian. Are these your friends? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Hello father. These fine fellows also may have an interest in your library as well. Along with some information about the house Cornthwaite lives in. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Uh, time of day check? </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Early afternoon</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Good afternoon, father. My name is Carmen Santamonica. These are my associates, Carl Handy and Prof. Plato. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: A pleasure to meet you, lass. I'm Father Haggarty</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Father Haggarty offers handshakes to all those around</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: And yeah, that house has a history behind it. There've been a few tragedies behind it. What were you wondering?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Lanta can I get a quick recap on what we know about the house omg I'm sorry &#62;.&#60;</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): And then the dude is missing now too. Right. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: We'd like to see the graves of a few specific people. The Gamwell family and the Fitzgerald family. And if you know anything about either.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Star you're doing great omg thank you</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Father leads the group back into the little graveyard. He leads them to two batches, one with the graves of Elma Fitzgerald (1865), Albert Fitzgerald (1865), Simon Fitzgerald (1865), and Grace Fitzgerald (1865), and then the other with the graves of Gloria Curwen (1895) and a single large tombstone for Harold, Sarah, and Susan Curwen (1895).</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The graves for Harold, Sarah, and Susan have flowers on them. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: It was quite the tragedy. Ol Arthur Curwen lost his mind and killed his family. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): (Thank you lanta I did mean Curwin and Fitzgerald)</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: But they never found him?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Aliens got him, right</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: Right. They found Jonny Fitzgerald's body, coward shot himself. Though we don't have a tombstone for him. He's buried out back by the rock near the tree. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: Curwen's been missing for... oh what's it been, like 30 years?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Anything stand out about the graves? Is it just names and dates on them?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Just the names and dates, and the flowers on the kids graves. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Spot Hidden check, though</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Can't help but notice the bouquets on these graves, do these folks have people in the area that still visit them Father?</font><br />

<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: That's my wife's doing. We don't take too kindly to kid-killers in these parts.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Thank you Carl. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): omg</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Rightfully so.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a pretty quiet day out, but unfortunately there's nothing extra of note with the scene. All are graves long since buried. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl does note a shovel sitting out by a shed</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: One last thing to ask, Father, is there anything you can tell us about Arthur Cornwaite? We understand he came back from an expidition and just about isolated himself from everyone on his return?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: Mmmm, mostly just isolated. He's always been kind about the community, but his recent trip seems to have hit him hard. Not anything I can say directly, mind you, but... well, I do worry about him. Sometimes, in the darkest moments, we lose sight of God's Light...</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Father Haggarty glances down at the flowers on the graves</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: Fortunately, Cornthwaite ain't got no kids of his own. Not that he's of that temperment, mind you</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Did Mr. Cornthwaite ever donate any books to you personally or ever come to you for things that stood out as odd? </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: No, no. It is kind of odd, he was always ordering books and picking them up in town. Books and papers and academic things</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Im assuming this was through the local post office or was there someone in particular that would get these for him? </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: Usually just through us or the general store. Either Cornthwaite himself or one of his servants would come up to fetch them from us. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: Salt?</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Father Haggarty blinks twice</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: Like some salt for the kitchen?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Flashback: The professor picks up a small slip of typed paper which has a receipt for an entire truck of salt on it; unsigned, indicating it hasn't been paid for yet. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: We came across an unsinged recipt for an entire truck of salt. Any idea where he would have that delivered? </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: I can't imagine why he'd have ordered an entire truck</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: On the occasions you saw him for a pick up, yourself, how was his demeanor? </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: Well usually it was pretty jovial, but he's been very subdued since his return. Only comes up here now to pick up the essentials. I think his cook quit on him, so he's taking care of all his cooking on his own. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: He asked Edith for some recipes</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Father Haggarty gestures toward his house</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Stands to reason why. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I'm out of questions</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Father, have you been to the estate since Cornthwaite went missing?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: No, not at all. I don't know if I've ever actually been there before. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Ah.  We were remiss in telling you why we are here.  Besides picking up the books, we are looking into Arthurs seeming disappearance and hoping to find any clues as to what may have happened.</font><br />

<font color="#DA8ADB">Carmen Santamonica: [ABILITY] Idea Check (85%) [Regular success] (Spend 7 of your 28 luck to make it a Hard Success.)</font> [d100 = 49]<br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Mostly for concern for the man. I am a private investigator but I'm not working in any official capacity yet.</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: I'm afraid I couldn't say. I'm just hoping he didn't opt for suicide.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: What would make you think he was going to kill himself? Did his last expedition end that poorly? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: Did you happen to know Arthur Curwen before the incident? any strange behavior or changes in behavior?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: It did end very poorly. I'm afraid I can't say specifically, what with things being shaerd in confidence. But I think anyone who saw him would conclude the same. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: Arthur Curwen, no. I wasn't living out here back then</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: It was about 30 years ago, so that doesn't surprise me.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Anyone got anything else? o.o</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: Well, if you do find anything, please let us know</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): He's a priest in the 20s he's probably used to it </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Thank you for your time, Father. We'll be sure to let you know if we find anything.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): The only person that knows more than priests in communities like this are sheriffs</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): And I think we got all we could out of this sheriff.</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Father Haggarty Father Haggarty continues upon his business, allowing the group to make their way back toward the town, and toward the house if they'd like. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Father Haggarty continues upon his business, allowing the group to make their way back toward the town, and toward the house if they'd like. </font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; GM: delete first</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: I think it's time we go take a look at this house. Do we have legal access?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): We could drive. Having Carl's truck nearby would be useful.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): They might not know anything about why it was ordered though</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): But that's not a bad thought! We could bring it up when Lanta gets back</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Welcome back Star!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Welcome back Lanta!!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Let's drive</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: We can introduce Lillian to the Mystery Mobile</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The group piles into Carl's little truck. The back of it is full of various tools and materials for the man's carpentry. The truck's only realy made to seat two, maybe three, in the cab. It can fit all four of you if you sit kinda uncomfortably, or one or more can ride in the back.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I can ride in the back it's fine moltovs unrelated</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Roll D100s for it?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The trip along the road isn't too eventful, and it's not long before the group's directions lead them to the old manse. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Despite it's dark past, the Fitzgerald Estate sits in a peaceful countryside. Resting on nearly 20 acres of woodland and rolling hills, the house itself is bordered bya high stone wall topped with iron spikes. Peering through the locked gates, our intrepid investigators look upon a tangled mess of a garden, stirring in a chill autumn breeze.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Anyone got the key to the gates?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Do I?</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica Checks her pockets</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The iron gate providing access to the driveway is padlocked. Looking through shows the wide driveway which leads toward the house, while other ill-defined plants lead off into the rambling garden. The house is visible ahead through the riot of plant life. Unfortunately, the key ring only contains keys to the front and back door. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Oh they totally gave me the keys didn't they?</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Carmen Santamonica: [SKILL] Natural World (10%) [Fail]</font> [d100 = 63]<br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Carl Handy: [SKILL] Natural World (10%) [Fail]</font> [d100 = 66]<br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Professor Plato: [SKILL] Natural World (10%) [Fail] (Spend 65 of your 65 luck to succeed.)</font> [d100 = 75]<br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: [SKILL] Natural World (10%) [Fail] (Spend 4 of your 55 luck to succeed.)</font> [d100 = 14]<br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): So close!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): We all have a 10 lol</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The main walkway up toward the house is clear, but the little side paths appear to be choked with weeds and long grasses. It's hard to tell when it was last tended, but you'd guess it's been months since anyone did gardening here. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Carl do you have some bolt cutters? </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Lanta they gave me the keys right?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Oh</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I'm sure he'd have bolt cutters, right?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): :&#62;</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): yes</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Sounds fine with me</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: We can go check with the Dodges if they have a key</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">While the fence does have spikes up top, there's also plenty of trees growing up and over the fence. It'd be easy to climb over</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Might be good to try and stay in the good graces of the sheriff</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Having the rest of these keys would be nice</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: To the Dodgers!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Swinging back, the lawyers are excessively apologetic about forgetting to give you the main key. They're really quite sheepish about the whole thing.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: And that's the last one they have?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Back to the house then.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heading back down to the house, the group can unlock the gate (finally) and drive their car up that quaint little driveway</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Easy access. Easy exit.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks like the Fitzgerald Estate came with an extensive garden, though it's clear that Cornthwaite's gardener has not tended to it in quite some time. Stone benches, planters, and even a fountain are all choked with weeds and plants. The trees include several exotic varieties, such as willows and chery plums. It's a wild expanse of runaway foliage, aggressively overgrown. It's a dark, dank green.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The house itself is silent, shuttered, and brooding. Cobwebbed by ivy, masked by trees, and caressed by the wind. It is large and apparently well-constructed, with high ceilings and thick, substantial windows, walls, and doors. From the outside, the entire edifice presents a strange, slightly skewed or tilted appearance. The foundations seem solid enough when viewed closely, but the house itself seems a little... crooked.</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica leads the group up to the front door, careful to avoid the overgrowth.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): in the 20s absolutely not </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The house has two stories, with doors front and (presumably) back. The front door waits atop a short flight of steps. The door is carved oak, the fine brass knocker cold to the touch. The windows are potential points of entry, but are currently shuttered. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Fortunately I have a key for this door as well.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): What day of the month is it again?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Nah if we weant to scope the outside let's do it together</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): want*</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: September</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Father Haggarty: Also, you guys can split the party c:</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Also, you guys can split the party c:</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): We don't NEED to so let's not</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Good idea, Carl.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Yeah would be a good idea to do a quick sweep</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Carmen Santamonica: [SKILL] Spot Hidden (60%) [Hard success] (Spend 15 of your 28 luck to make it an Extreme Success.)</font> [d100 = 27]<br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: [SKILL] Spot Hidden (25%) [Fumble]</font> [d100 = 96]<br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Professor Plato: [SKILL] Spot Hidden (41%) [Regular success] (Spend 13 of your 65 luck to make it a Hard Success.)</font> [d100 = 33]<br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carl Handy: grabs his tool pouch and sledgehammer.</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Carl Handy: [SKILL] Spot Hidden (50%) [Regular success] (Spend 3 of your 48 luck to make it a Hard Success.)</font> [d100 = 28]<br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Don't forget to mark the skill if you succeed!  </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The property's foliage seems unusually green to everyone in the group. Carmen, Plato, and Handy note how thereh's a lot more leaves and foliage cover in here than there was along the route. Lillian notices mostly that the leaves keep finding their way to her face, the result of unfortunate wind gusts and Carl not checking behind him twice when he pushed vines out of the way. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The garden path circles the property, giving an angle on all sides of the house. The windows around the house are all shuttered shut. You make note of a the back door, as well as a pair of wooden hatches at the rear of the property to give access to the wood cellar.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Nature is not my friend today</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">On either side of the path, greenery chokes the space and encroaches in what was once a spacious walkway. It's hard to walk down without pushing leaves out of the way. A small garden shed comes into view, green paint peeling and its door slightly ajar. Beyond it, blocking the rest of the loop, it seems a tree has finally succumb to some sort of fungal infection and fallen across. It's covered in mushrooms, which have practically burst fourth to spread through the surrounding foliage.</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: Or perhaps nature is being too friendly :p</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Let's check that shed.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Wtf xD</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): No thank you for not trying to give us rabies</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): He's a man with faith hi science</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): in*</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Nachooooooooo!</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: :3c</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inside, the shed is dark, and a carpet of leaves and detritus cover the floor. There are lots of tools: rakes, a wheelbarrow, shovels, some hedge-clippers, a pick, a saw, and so on&#8212;many of these have fallen to the floor. All are disused and a little dirty, and some are a little rusty.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Hm. Nothing too useful then.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Carl you probably have non rusty versions of all of this in your truck</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Love me some spot checks.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Can't blame me for wondering about the tools though!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Wouldn't think of it.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Welcome back Lanta!!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Might be worth taking hedge-clippers with if they look like they're still in decent shape </font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Carmen Santamonica: [SKILL] Spot Hidden (60%) [Regular success] (Spend 27 of your 28 luck to make it a Hard Success.)</font> [d100 = 57]<br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Better!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looking through the shed, the one thing that sticks out is an empty rack. It appears someone has taken an axe, and hasn't put it back. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): concerning</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Chekov's missing axe...</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): yeah if they aren't rusted over</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): You can use Lillian, I'm listening for Carmen</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): you swap!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Nice!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: I think I'd like to grab some rope before we head into the house.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Good idea Carl...</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: The swap comes later, after the aliens get ahold of you</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Erenville tying you up hawu?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Hey, if I can't stash things in my coat, they'e be in a backpack</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: There's definitely rope back in the truck. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Let's get that rope.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I also have some rope on me </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Get that rope!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Going to what??</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Lanta come baaack ;n;</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: one moment while I investigate</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Noooooo!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: I can hear you guys fine</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The group circles back around, heading toward the truck to grab some rope. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Can I have everyone roll an INT check for me?</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: [ABILITY] Idea Check (55%) [Regular success] (Spend 8 of your 55 luck to make it a Hard Success.)</font> [d100 = 35]<br />

<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: You don't hear any birds. Nor crickets or bugs, there aren't even any mosquitos.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): That roll was to make sure we didn't get lost</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Carmen Santamonica: You don't hear any birds. Nor crickets or bugs, there aren't even any mosquitos.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Hmm... little too quiet, don't you think?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: yeah</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: way too quiet</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Everyone just, keep your eyes open.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl and Plato don't hear anything. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Makes it harder to hide sounds so maybe it's to our advantage...</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heading back to grab their ropes (and/or Molotovs), the group is prepared for further exploration. How do they enter this forboding abode?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: I have the key for it.</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica knocks first.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Before we go in does it look like there have been any recent signs of entry? Within the past couple days </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Ooooh good question</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Make an INT check to examine the door</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Looking closely, the Professor doesn't think there's any sign of forced entry. The lock's not new, but it's not excessively scratched up like one might expect from a forced lock. </font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica knocks second</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The knock is loud and hollow. But nobody seems to respond. </font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica tries the key</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The key fits in easily, clicking and allowing Carmen to swing the door open</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">As the front door unlocks and slides open, the first thing that hits you is the scent. The house has a strong odor to it, like mildew or mold. The interior is dark, all the shutters preventing most of the light from making it in. </font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica pushes the door open and peers inside</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Flashlights?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Maybe some window opening is in order.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I have some uh... matches. No lantern</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: maybe some candles around here</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Can y'all see your characters?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I see not the Professor</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): But everyone else</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: lol my poor computer is strugglebussing</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Somehow, my computer's CPU is at 100%</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): o.o</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Maybe a quick restart is in order?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: HM</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Let's... keep sweeping the place.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">A stovetop fireplace sits against one wall, with shelves, cupboards, and a sink lining the rest. On the shelf above the stove, there is a series of four metal canisters labeled flour, sugar, tea, and coffee, with a space between the tea and coffee large enough for another can.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">A piece of plaster has fallen off the wall and looks damp to the touch. To the south, there are three doors, and an open door to the north leading to the summer kitchen.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Im gonna look in the stove</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): open</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): POOF</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Opening the stove, there's only a few pots and pans within. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): That was a bit of a jump</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The breeze after opening the windows in the kitchen is a relief</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): anything in the pots in the stove?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Maybe some pictures?</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Also Aya would like to know if there's anything in the pots?</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Carmen Santamonica: You can hear a kid singing, faintly, upstairs.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Already answered</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Oh I was not looking for green </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): There's singing coming from upstairs...</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: There's singing coming from upstairs...</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Faint but it's a child</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen can't make out the words, but if y'all go closer you might be able to</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: ya know I haven't heard a single child since we got in here</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Save upstairs for when we get up there. Let's finish this floor first.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Out to the west window, you can see there's steps leading up to a little porch</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): It was mentioned earlier that there was a piece of plaster that fell off the wall. Is there like a hole in the wall from where the palster fell?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a hole exposing the bricks and insulation</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Banger of a hanger</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The second door opens up to a little pantry space, which immediately hits everyone with the smell of rot. The water damage is in here too, and it soaked through the food supplies. It's all gone bad</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Anyone wanna stick their hand in the hole in the wall? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The third door is stuck. The water damage has caused it to swell, leaving the door stuck in its frame.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the final door opens to...</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">...the hallway from earlier</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yeh xD</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): yeah you've got a hammer right?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: I say we pry it open</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): me too. He said he checked the place out and said it seemed fine</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: He said he was here, didn't he?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Yes he did </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: The third lawyer never stepped inside</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: he came here and got spooked</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: The sheriff though...</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: The newspaper from a few days ago said the Sheriff inspected the mansion and grounds and said there was no cause for alarm</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I'd say this is pretty alarming</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: So either a ton of water damage happened VERY fast</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: or hes lying</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Child: It's not dinner time yet, we'll get in trouble!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Behind the four of you, a small girl is standing in the corner of the kitchen. Maybe 8 or 9 years old, she still clings to an old fashioned doll. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I'd also say that is pretty alaraming</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): YAAAAY!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): what happened to alvin</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Does she appear to be talking TO us? Like is she aware of us in front of her?</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Also do the people who succeeded their spot hidden checks want to say anything?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wind blows through the open windows, a soft howl sounding through the room</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Star if you want to try to ask if she's someone then you can totally go for it</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: is your brother Simon also with you?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">She cuts herself off there, and it's a very sudden sort of movement. She seems a little off, but it's hard to put your fingers on.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Harder too, for Lillian, as she reaches over and puts her hand straight through the girl. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: POW check for Lillian</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I'm not sure if she was actually responding to us or if this is more like a projection almost </font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: You feel a great deal of anxiety in your chest, your brother trying to sneak some cake before dinner. The feeling blurs quickly into a longing for your mother, fear shooting through you in her absense.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The girl turns and runs, pushing literally through the rest of Lillian and through the open doorway to the hall. As she passes into the shadows, you lose sight of her. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: I noticed her dress wasn't moving from the wind in the room</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Lillian Lovell: Gasping suddenly and clenching her chest stands back up and takes a few deep breaths to calm down</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: If she was reacting to us at all, it was very limited. Lillian are you alright?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: That was quite the experience. I noticed something similar which is why I think its more a projection than an actual ghost</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: But, she did seem to respond when you said her name.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: I wonder if she was trying to warn us...</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Yeah when she ran through me I was overtaken by a pretty strong bout of fear. Like I was watching my brother do something he shouldn't</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I mean a projection as in like a playback</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: like film</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Or maybe that's all she's capable of</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I also felt a strong need to call out for my mother. </font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): One was a pantry and the other was stuck?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two doors lie open, one to the hall and the other to the laundry room. The door to the pantry, due to the stench, is being kept closed. The remaining door, likely to the basement, is stuck shut. The water damage has caused the wood of the door to swell. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Basements...</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): same</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): He said there was no cause for alarm in the paper</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: It's okay, this basement has fewer than one full human body in it</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Gonna let that slide Hawu</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Moving to the hall, there's one more door to check</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Wanna open it?</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica opens the door to the hall</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">A small linen closet is revealed, full of crusty old linens.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Carl would you like to check?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: You could try to taste them instead if you'd prefer </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately, without touching them, you can't really tell if they've got a mineral buildup or something else going on with them. </font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica steps back</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carl Handy: pokes at a piece of cloth with a screwdriver.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scraping at it with a screwdriver, it seems to come off in little flakes. </font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Doesn't seem to be.  Just some nasty old linens.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just more sheets and the like. It's a pretty standard linen closet. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: albeit in bad shape</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Close it up and let's move on</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: The state of this place does not match the impression I had from the sherrif and attorneys.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: goals</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Not at all.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Lillian, Professor, we're heading upstairs.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: stay clear of windows, and beds</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Does anyone wanna remain behind?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): nope! Not after that last experience</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: All we're missing is a talking dog...</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Lillian Lovell: Tries lighting a cigarette as she follows</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Heading up the stairs, the group enters a small hallway. To the north is just darkness, only lit up by your flashlights. But you can see hints of light to the south where a window is shuttered closed. The wind outside seems to make the building creek, almost as if it were breathing.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Hawu that was... an effort</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The cigarette smoke is a welcome change of pace to the smell of the house. </font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I'm going to!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Hey let's go check on Carl!</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: I was actually right as this carl incident was happening typing out that I was going to head back to everyone else while keeping an eye out for more salt barriers</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen steps outside of the room, and looks down toward Carl. Carl is leaning over to look down the hall, meeting Carmen's eye for a second</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica Looks both ways before exiting a room</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: You do not spot any additional salt barriers over here, none as obvious as the ones in Cornthwaite's room</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I HAVE to use the restroom omg brb</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Professor Plato: You feel a notable drip on your hat, like maybe a mouthful of water just landed on you. It splashes off, and though your hat keeps you mostly dry, it does get on your shoulders and stuff.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Bio break! </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen checks both ways, and it's only on the second check to the south the figure duck into the room on the west. It looks like an older boy. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I'm back!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Thank you! &#60;3</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): That room?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Locked, yeah. And she said it was when I was looking south. So it's for sure that room</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Back!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Welcome back Lanta!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: are you still dry, Carmen? i seem to have had a bit of water, i think, dropped on my hat</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica checks herself and her clothing for dampness or anything missing</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Carmen is dry</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen is dry</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: (POLL) Everyone back?</font><br />

<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Carmen Santamonica: While watching the ceiling, Carmen strolls around the room to get better angles on it and see if she can notice any additional dripping. She doesn't, but she does notice a couple of books under the bed from this angle.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Professor... keep an eye on where the drips are for me.</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica leans down and fishes the books she noticed from under the bed</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Mmmm &#62;:T</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">One book that she finds is the Golden Bough. The other is what appears to be a personal diary, hand written</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica tucks the named book under her arm and opens the diary to the last written page</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Oh of course we are no right now</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Lilian, I heard an older boy warning someone to hide because someone was coming.  I don't know if it was...a warning to us?  Or something like we saw before, almost a memory of something that happened before.  I think we should regroup and tell the others.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Tihat's probably a good idea. I have an idea of what we may be seeing</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: I took that out</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica mumbles to herself, &#34;What IS it though?&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica flips back a few pages, scaning for a description. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Professor, did you notice a suitcase anywhere?</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Carmen Santamonica: Description of what?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: None of you have seen a travel suitcase yet</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): It's probably in the attic</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: i don't recall seeing one</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Carmen Santamonica: location of where they were or what they were looking for. I guess he said &#34;I can't explain it&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The pages before this seem to be talking about how excited Cornthwaite is to be going out to their site. It seems they only had a day left before arriving to their destination, on the page before the last two entries. </font><br />

<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Professor Plato: There's a bunch of water stains all over the ceiling, but you notice something along the far wall. A bulge in the wall, slowly moving along it for several inches before vanishing.</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Professor Plato: are the stains the same as what we saw entering the room?</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Professor Plato: You're pretty sure the stain that was above you when you got wetted was not there when you first entered (you would not have stood beneath it)</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: there seems to be stains all over the ceiling. i dont remember them all being there. and i swear i saw the wall bulge as if something was inside it and it moved. but it disappeared quickly</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Wall bulge...</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: I'd rather not stay in here.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: agreed</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Lillian, I found another book.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: oh? Which one? </font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica hands her The Golden Bough</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The pair step out into the hallway, reuiniting with their companions before any of them get got</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Excellent! Now we're just missing one!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: I also found Arthur Cornthwaite's diary.</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica passes it around for the others to look over</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carl Handy relays what he heard the voice of the older boy saying to the pressor and Carmen</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: What's the last book we're looking for?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: De Occulta Philosophia</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Its probably hiding somewhere nefarious</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a simple and modest bedroom with two beds set up, as well as wardrobes and an open closet. Water appears to have leaked across the celing and down onto the beds, ruining them both. It's empty, except for a wet blouse on the floor. A vanity desk and mirror, alongside an empty makeup kit on the desk, suggest it to be a woman's room.</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica checks the closet</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The closet and one wardrobe appear mostly empty, with only a single wet blouse on the floor of the closet. The other wardrobe is full.</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): ?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: No books are found within this room's belongings.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The group steps back out into the hall. Wind blows through the open windows, giving a fresh breeze as the building creaks softly. Something elsewhere in the house seems to thunk. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Can we tell where it came from?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Like above, below?</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Another sparcely decorated room, this waterstained bedroom appears to have been repurposed. The bed has been shoved to the corner, and a table moved to the center. A black powder sits in nine neat little piles on the edge of the desk, next to an empty salt shaker. Similarly, a couple of mostly empty containers of cleaning solutions lay discarded on the ground.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aside from that, this room has a desk and a few photographs on top. They mostly depict the same man with a great big bushy beard, alongside a number of other boys, girls, men, and women who seem to share a family resemblence.</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Carmen Santamonica: Sounded like below, and to the other end of the house.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): That may have come from the kitchen...</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Three of you hear someone knocking on the door downstairs. </font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Professor Plato: You swear you hear a kid say &#34;Don't let Johnny see you&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I can sneak a look out the window </font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Professor Plato: Very softly, barely a whisper</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: What did you hear professor?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Then you should say something!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: i just heard a kid whisper &#34;don't let johnny see you&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looking out the window, you can see the porch roof. Again, you can hear the knock, almost easier to hear through the window</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Do we know a Johnny? o.o</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: John Fitzgerald was the one claimed to have shot his father and family</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: From 60 years ago?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: that's the one</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The knocking on the door stops</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica leans out the window</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Hello? Someone down there at the door?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Man's Voice (faintly): Oh, yeah? Wait, who said that?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Does it sound like that came from the front door?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Good question</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Yup</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Private investigator here on personal business. Up on the second floor and I heard you knock. Can I ask you to identify yourself, sir?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stepping off the porch and looking up, the man shields his eyes so he can see you. </font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica gives a small wave</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Man: Oh, hello there!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's fairly well dressed, and has an axe over his shoulder. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Man: Mind if I come in? Or did you wanna come down?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Man: Kinda hard to talk from way down here</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: I've had enough of a day that I'd like answers to a couple questions first before coming down, if it's all the same to you. Your name, sir?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Joe Virelli! And you, ma'am?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Carmen Santamonica. Where you from Joe?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: From a neighboring town you've never heard of, lotta like Gamwell itself! I don't suppose Arthur's back, is he? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Well, there are a couple Arthurs missing. Looking for Arthur Cornthwaite, sir?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: What? Well yeah, what other Arthur are you talking about?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Psychology roll from each of y'all?</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): My job is to lie not to spot lies</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joe appears to be pretty sincerely confused with the Arthur comment</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): That's fine</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Last question, sir, then I'll be glad to come down. What are ya here for?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Well, I was just wandering about, minding my own business, and wound up finding this out on the property. Figured I'd return it and see if he's back yet</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Joe Virelli flashes a smile at the woman in the window</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: No sir, he's not back yet. But you're welcome to drop the axe off at the shed around back and be on your way.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Carl you want me to ask more questions?</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica she asks, without alerting Joe she's talking to someone else</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Uhuh. And what about you, ma'am? What brings you to the second floor of a house belonging to someone else when they're not home?</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Joe Virelli: [SKILL] Psychology (55)</font> [d100 = 41]<br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Just here to retrieve some objects he donated to an organization I'm a part of. Was given the keys to his house by his lawyers, checked with the sheriff before heading in.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): xD</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Ah, like the Society of the Unexplained? Found anything neat in there other than books? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: So you're familar? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: We've found... a little more than just the books we've been looking for. But I'd rather not say more before you put down that axe.</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): There is a big gap in the floor between the hall and the front door</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Indeed, there was another guy working for the newspaper by the name of Joe Virelli, and now that you think about it you saw the name printed on a lot of the news papers y'all had to delve through. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): So he can't rush us at least</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Joe Virelli. You work at the newspaper?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): We could head down to the front door</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: That's me! I see my name's made a mark, eh?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: And, Joe. You put that axe in the shed around back and I'll meet you at the front door. Deal?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Not yet</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): The knocking took priority</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Can I just leave it by the door? I'd have to walk all the way around</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: It'll give me time to get downstairs.</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Aw c'mon, I can see the stairs from here. Come on down</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Joe Virelli steps up onto the porch again, whistling as he heads into the open door</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Joe, just to let you know. The floor isn't safe. Probably shouldn't walk in!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I'm gonna try and make my way down stairs unnoticed </font><br />

<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: [SKILL] Climb (50%) [Fail] (Spend 34 of your 55 luck to succeed.)</font> [d100 = 84]<br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't really speak to the integrity of the roof, but at least it's not as bad as the interior</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Does Joe hear my warning about the floor?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Is there anything sturdy I can tie a rope to up here? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't say anything back to y'all, but you can't see him</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Gdi</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Gfdi</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I was trying to be careful :T</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Did I really say we?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: We've found... a little more than just the books we've been looking for. But I'd rather not say more before you put down that axe.</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Carmen Santamonica: We've found... a little more than just the books we've been looking for. But I'd rather not say more before you put down that axe.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): heck I did</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): This is joe normal man afawk</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: If he walks up the stairs with the axe I draw my gun on him.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: If not we talk to him.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's been a good 30s now, and he's not come up the stairs yet. </font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica calls down the stairs </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Joe?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): was there an answer to my  previous question?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Is there anything sturdy I can tie a rope to up here? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, there's a little pull-down attic hatch that you can pull and get a ladder. You could tie any rope to that</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Cool I'm gonna tie my rope around the sturdiest looking thing and then myself and carefully shimmy my way onto the roof </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Opening that attic is a step beyond</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Probably not the attic hatch</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could use the bedroom, tie a rope to the bed, and then climb out of one of those windows onto the little roof</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): thats not a bad idea</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): My plan is to see if he's just waiting axe drawn for one of us to come down </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): While all this is happening Lillian is following down behind him surely</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): I've had enough of those already lol </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeking down from the roof, Lillian can confirm that the axe is sitting outside. The door's left open as well, and there's no sign of an axe murderer (nor of Joe Virelli)</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">The little girl from the kitchen, Grace, is standing at the far side of the room. She holds a finger up to her lips, then turns and runs down the little side hallway. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I have the gun. I will not be using it unless absolutely necessarry</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Where am I hearing these draweres opening and closing from?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The downstairs area</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: You three stay up here and check that room. I'll get Joe to leave or at least agree to chill out if he won't help.</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Simp? Not me.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen and Carl head downstairs, the two of them finding Joe over in the Study. He's only lightly shifting through stuff on the desk. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Oh, hello there! </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): You are not as bad as my pathfinder group hawu</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): And you figured it out! :D Good job Lanta!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): That is a group of 6 unmedicated adhd 30+ year olds</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Hey Joe. Sorry for being a bit cagy. Like I mentioned before there's been some odd things happening.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Helps to be careful, ya know?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: I'll say. Seems like someone did a number on this place</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: When's the last time you been here?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Oh, probably like a week or so ago. I swung by to check on him and finalize details for a quick article, but nobody was here. Thanks for letting me in, by the way</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: We didn't let you in, buster.</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carl Handy glares at &#34;Joe&#34; angrily.</font><br />

<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Carmen Santamonica: Joe is standing so he's facing the south, mostly, as he talks to you. Behind him, past the doorway to the hall, you see a small blue-eyed boy, watching in the darkness under the stairs.</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Meanwhile, upstairs...</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Another sparcely decorated room, this waterstained bedroom appears to have been repurposed. The bed has been shoved to the corner, and a table moved to the center. A black powder sits in nine neat little piles on the edge of the desk, next to an empty salt shaker. Similarly, a couple of mostly empty containers of cleaning solutions lay discarded on the ground.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aside from that, this room has a desk and a few photographs on top. They mostly depict the same man with a great big bushy beard, alongside a number of other boys, girls, men, and women who seem to share a family resemblence.</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Is sulpher yellow?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">There are several glass containers here from the vanity set, but they don't seem to be full of their normal contents. Given the containers nearby, they seem to be storing cleaning solutions like bleach and vinegar. Looking closely at the powder, the professor is pretty sure this is gunpowder. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Light it</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Checking out the bed, Lillian notices several unusual stains on it, as well as a pile of salt around a clean section of the bed</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Clean??</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): What color are these stains and what does unusual mean...</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Unusual in the sense that they're not like the stains everywhere else. You can smell that one of them is vinegar, but you can't really identify the others. Definitely not water for all of them</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Carmen can walk in and explain to Lillian and Plato </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): yeah probabliy not at this poitn </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): yeah he doesn't have the axe</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: So, he seems harmless enough. His name is Joe. He's from the local press.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Just a quick announcement here: I got some feedback from y'all, and I want to adjust how we do our exploration and fact-finding. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): WELL, I think we DID decide on that first thing, I don't remember if there was a consensu on the second part</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: One common point is that there's a bit of difficulty with order of actions and with more tension. So to address those I want to implement Turns, similar to OD&#38;D</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yeah okay that would make sense!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: One Turn is 30min, and allows you to do a thorough search. You can do a sped up search in 15min if you accept +1P (one penalty die) for your roll. Spending a Turn looking things over suggests a more thorough investigation than just glancing around. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: This will both ensure that all four players are able to do something (rather than one player getting accidentally steamrolled) and also put a bit of a cost on your searches</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): that makes sense</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: You could all spend a Turn searching Cornthwaite's room, but that means we go from 4:00pm to 4:30pm. If you all fail, you can do it again, but then it goes from 4:30pm to 5:00pm</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: This should also encourage splitting up, since reasonably you don't need four of you doing a search in one room to expect at least one success</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): ...With how we roll?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: Though if you want to, you absolutely can, it'll just take twice as long</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Either or would be fine with me based on GM feeling for the situation</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: If you have two or more people searching a room, you can split the work up to make it go faster. One person checks one half, and the other person checks the other half, and it takes half as long. BUT, if someone misses their roll on the upper half, y'all may miss information that is hidden their (ie the secret fireplace)</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): This is making logical sense and helping to bridge the dice and real world. I like it!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): I'm not carmen is </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The group gathers up on the upper balcony, with a new addition of a Mr Joe Virelli. Carmen catches the Professor and Lillian up as they join in. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: So, you're all looking for books, was it? And Arthur?</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Joe Virelli positions himself closer to the window so he can breathe</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: The books are the primary reason we're here. Yes. Arthur's disappearance stuck odd so we decided to look around</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Hey, I'm all for it</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Y'all know that Joe's been with the Gamwell Gazette for probably 10 years, or at least he's been writing articles for them for that long. You had to go through a lot of his stuff when looking for facts about Cornthwaite</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): And the major events of the house were 30 and 60 years ago</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Professor do you want to interrogate Joe?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: How much have you searched?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Majority of the house. Only a few rooms left, maybe one on first and one on this floor. Not the basement or the attic. Yet.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: There's a door on the first floor off the kitchen that we suspect goes to the basement. There's also the door to the right behind me that is locked. </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: I remember when Arthur moved in, most of the old furntiure left here was just crammed into the basement rather than bother selling it. Who knows what's down there now?</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Joe Virelli leans over to check out the door</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Hopefully not our last missing book.</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Could try picking or forcing the lock</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Could always try the attic since were right here anyways </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): What's locckpicking check for?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Yeh but what skill,  sorry?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yeah mine is a 20</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Also, that's quite the accent you've got there, ma'am. Mind if I ask where you're from? I can't quite place it</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: Can I ask what brings you here, Joe? looking for Arthur, but I imagine a reporter isn't here just to return an axe. Is there some lead you're following up on?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Who's Joe asking?</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Lillian Lovell Points to herself &#34;me?&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): she does</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Joe Virelli nods his head, pointing at Lillian</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: My parents and I emigrated from Romania when I was young. Learning English was a bit hard at first</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: It is a tough language, indeed</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli (to the Professor): Oh, I figured I'd take a look around to see if he'd returned. I was checking the property, I figured he might've tripped and fallen or something, but no sign of any bodies out there. I found the axe sorta tossed by the wayside, though. It'd been out there long enough to get sticky with something, but wasn't rusted or anything</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Sticky?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Yeah, it'd gotten sap or something on it, just kinda gross like</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Joe, you seem to be familiar with Arthur and said you've been here before.  Was the house always this way?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: No way. I mean, it's been a few weeks since I came around, but it was fine back then</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Quick check for anyone with a locksmith skill better than 20?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): I too can provide moral support</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I'll keep that in mind Lanta! I'll probably do that after we're done with are initial conversation with Joe here</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Did you see Arthur at all after he got back from his expidition?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yes</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Yeah, I did the interview with him when he first got back, wrote the article a few days ago when nobody could find him too</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: Joe, have you talked with Sam since you've been back? He mentioned visiting the property a few days ago.</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: No, haven't been back yet</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): I think he may have been just referring to general troubles and using &#34;Dont go starting any fires&#34; as a turn of phrase</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Joe, you mentioned being familiar with the Society we represent.  Are you a believer in the paranormal?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: I've never seen anything myself, but if there's such a thing as hauntings... well, this would be one of them</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">As if to back him up, the building creeks softly</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Y'all haven't seen a horse on property, have you? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: No horse. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: We haven't but we have heard about potential horsenappings in the area</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Yeah I was hoping to find that or Cornthwaite, ideally alive of course. Put on my hiking boots and everything for it. We wanna grab a seat somewhere and keep chatting, or shall we check out the attic or door?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I think we plan on checking this door first </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Carl, give me a hand and we'll try this door. Unless you think you're better with a lock, Joe?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Nah, I try to make it a point not to break in. That sorta thing gets you shot around these parts</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: I'm going to take a seat if that's fine with y'all</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Joe Virelli wanders into the Servant's room on the left</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Professor, could you keep an eye on Joe for me?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: Sure thing Ms Lovell</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli (from the other room): Oh what is this?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Carl, Carmen was asking for help, not Lillian</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Mogstew (Carl Handy): I am out of sorts</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Vibing until I'm called upon</font><br />

<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica *click</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Huh, that worked.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): I suppose I can check on joe</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Joe Virelli takes a seat on a corner of the bed and leans forward, poking at the stuff on the table</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Did you find something Joe? </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: I mean a bunch of piles of... gunpowder? </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: delete first</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Looks like someone was doing some science experiment in here, huh? </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Not the usual room for it</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica tries the unlocked knob.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Yeah we were checking this room out earlier. Between that and the bedstain we weren't entirely sure what they were doing in here </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">It doesn't take too long before Carmen's able to undo the old lock, and Carl slides the door open</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Inside, gathering dust, are loot from tombs the world over: pots, vases, statuettes, carvings, musical instruments, idols, and more. Some seem to leer and snicker at you in the gloom. A couple have already been smashed into unrecognizable fragments. All stare with painted outrage, flat eyes hostile to the men who removed them from their ancestral homes. Sitting on a propped up spot is a leather-bound book; De Occulta Philosophia etched in the front.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Found you...</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): This was the last one wasn't it?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): We sure do!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Under the beed in Cornthwaite's room?</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica looks side to side, pulling her hat down as she crosses each set of eyes to retrieve the book</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The book is easily retrieved from its stand. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Oh right the suitcase! We should keep an eye out for that still</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Carl, can you try the door on the south wall for me?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Welcome back Star!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The southern door opens to a small closet, which seems to have a number of exploration outfits on it. The sort of thing that one might wear down in the jungle. There are several empty hangers, though, as if some of the outfits are missing</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Absolutely, but touching the least amount of objects possible</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): I am simply still vibing with Joe over here if you wanna go take a look</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Professor Plato: [SKILL] Science - Forensics (65%) [Hard success] (Spend 9 of your 62 luck to make it an Extreme Success.)</font> [d100 = 22]<br />

<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: Anything in particular that you want to talk with Joe about? Or do?</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: maybe just talk to him about the guy who lives here. See if he saw him acting strange after his last trip or saw anything else strange. Otherwise just small talk to keep an eye on him</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Fair yeh</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: Go ahead and make a Charm roll for me then</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: [SKILL] Charm (80%) [Regular success] (Spend 33 of your 55 luck to make it a Hard Success.)</font> [d100 = 73]<br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Looking through the artifacts, the Professor can't spot any that were added recently. There's a few spots open, as if room was left open for them, but the dust on them indicate that nothing had ever been placed here. It seems like Cornthwaite didn't put anything in here after his last trip, and maybe hadn't even been in here in months. </font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: He chats about it, and a lot of what he says conveys the same sort of thing that you've heard from the priest. Cornthwaite seemed really skittish after his trip, and Joe describes him as having lost his old cheer that he'd had</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: I'll ask him if the house had always been kinda decrepit or does it seem like it decayed faster than it should have</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl notices that there's a rack for a rifle or shotgun. It's empty at the moment, its gun missing in action. There's also an empty box of cartridges for a shotgun.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen just keeps noticing the different eyes. Even the water damage on the walls and ceiling seem to form faces in the gloom, looking down on the group.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Star I appreciate your observations!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">(To add to the Professor's roll): While it looks like none of the trophies have been dusted or touched, there are some light signs of other presence. Of particular note, it does look like someone went into the drawyer for the box of bullets, and relatively recently. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: We should see if we could get the society to return these to where they came from</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: Definitely the latter, he has no idea what kinda leak caused this damage but it's really bad</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: I'll follow this up with if cornthwaite or anyone near him had been looking into any local urban legends or any sort of paranormally/cryptid things</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: RETCON: The nine piles on the table were little piles of lead pellets, rather than gunpowder</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: So from what we've noticed. It looks like whoever took the gun wanted to load the gun with salt</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">There is a second container of bullets as well, this one full, and thus plenty of gunpowder for the professor to gather if he'd like</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): You are your character!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): So if you make the jump, the Carl makes the jump!</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: Not that he knows about, and he'd know about that. But there were occasional people hypothesizing about Curwen's whereabouts or ghosts of old Johnny Fitzgerald and his family</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): THANKS HAWU XD</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Do y'all want to collect up the trophies as well so you can get them returned to where they came from?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Yes</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): A workshop maybe?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Garage?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Shed?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): basement garage shed somewhere private that wont start my house on fire</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: I wanna take a look at the walls and see if there are any stains that would indicate the leaking is coming from the attic</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: (POLL) Go past the dead body to get to the attic?</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Can we take time to get the tophies into Carl's truck?</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: Now that is a good question. Make an INT or Spot Hidden check</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): If we're leaving the trophies here that's fine. Seems like they should be returned home</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: If we're leaving the trophies here that's fine. Seems like they should be returned home</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Maybe we come back then</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: Do you want to push that roll? By tracing along the walls, up close, and maybe standing on the bed or chairs, you'd be able to tell more clearly.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Good point Professor.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Let's try the attic.</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: yeah I'll push the roll anyway to get closer to the ceiling. Will ask joe to help if he's willing</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Maybe we come back if we have better reason to before we leave</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: get up close and personal with the walls too</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: For a pretty gal like you? Absolutely! Roll with a bonus die</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Nice roll :D</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: I'm gonna spend 4 luck to make that a hard success</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: [ABILITY] Luck Check (55%) [Regular success]</font> [d100 = 43]<br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): ignore that</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): But it was good tho :O</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): HEY</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): :3c</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: Looking up toward the top, it really doesn't look like there's any direct stains leaking down from above, despite all the damage along the walls and ceiling. They seem pretty splotchy, with lines connecting them, but they don't seem to be like consistent top-down lines</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I'm waiting for Carl and the Professor to catch up first</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The ladder to the stairs creaks loudly as it comes down, audible to all the people on the top floor. </font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: do the lines seem to follow a certain pattern or originating point? Also is Joe holding onto me currently? If he is is he kinda oddly moist?</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: No, they don't radiate from any one spot. Most have at least a few trails leading to other darker splotches, but it's sporadic.</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica peaks into the west servent's room for a quick look</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Lillian, Joe, we're going to check the attic. Everything going okay in here?</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; Lillian Lovell: He's not moist, but he does seem to be a bit handsy. That said, he's doing a good job stabilizing you and making sure you don't slip.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian is on the bed, with Joe helping stabilize her as she stands on the frame to peek at the highest part of the wall</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica raises an eyebrow.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Just checking out the water stains on the walls to see if its coming from the attic!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: It doesn't seem like it is so whatever is causing all the damage I don't think its coming from the attic </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">In his defense, Joe is standing next to the bed, one hand up for her to hold and the other hand ready to catch her if she falls</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): STAR YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: ...Like I said. We're about to head up there. I'd like to stay on the same floor, or at least a staircase away.</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: Lillian is pretty used to handsy dudes in the circus so this is nothing new. The spot checking is appreciated</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Lillian Lovell Gets down from the bed grabbing joes hand &#34;Carmen is right we should join them&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Yes ma'am!</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): That was me trying to get some more info</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Mind if I take a look through the rest of this floor? Get a feel of the place? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Based off our experience with this place I'd say adventuring alone is a bit unwise. </font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica looks back at Joe, then glances at the rest of the group.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: We should definitely stay together.</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: What sort of experience have you had?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: This house has some little nooks and crannies you can fall in</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Some of the floors don't seem stable either.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: If you find a passage that we missed and we dont hear you go missing we may not find you again </font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Oh that's a bit... ominous</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Wait, you found a secret passage?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Wait, wait, where was that?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: We can discuss that once we've cleared this out. Promise</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Attic first. Then we can show you. No splitting up.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): That implies we found a passage yeah</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Joe Virelli groans</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Alright, alright</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: When we've cleared this place out I gaurantee you you'll have the biggest story you've ever written</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Oh right. Lillian, I found this in the locked room.</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica hands her the last book.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Oh good! That makes all five!</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: I had a thought. We might want to review some of these before we hand them off for collection.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): I have a pretty high STR too</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: That last one specifically </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: a good idea </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Something to come back to after we're out of this place. Anyway.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: I already thumbed through one for any notes. Might give us an idea on what happened tog Arthur </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Once we have a moment to sit we can take a better look amongst us </font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica nods to Lillian then turns her attention to the open stairway.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">This open space contains lots of junk, from each of the families who have lived here. There are old chests, a rocking horse, a broken mirror, a locked wardrobe, a tailor&#8217;s dummy, odd bits of furniture, and so on. The only significant water damage appears to be along the floors, rather than the ceiling.</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Can i take 5 to touch grass?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): YAY! &#60;3</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The group splits up a bit, covering more ground through the the small paths. The furniture is a mix of eras, some being old fashioned stuff from the 1800s and others being more recent. It appears mostly the stuff on the west side is more old, and the stuff on the east side is more new. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The light that filters in from the vents is barely enough to see, but the intrepid investigators has some flashlights. It seems like a lot of the furniture and boxes have an almost shiny sheen to them, an irridescent reflection. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Interestingly, as the group makes it toward the north end of the attic space, one trunk has been absolutely flattened outwards. Burst as if an explosion had taken place in its interior. The inside are the remains of jungle clothing; a pith helmet, a compass, a .45 revolver, and a machete. This stuff in particular is very shiny, though dry to the touch. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: (POLL) Ready to continue?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Does the compas point north?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): I mean we're orented I know where north is, Star!</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: What the heck happened here?</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Joe Virelli peeks over Carmen's shoulder, from the back of the group</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Does the compass point north??</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): And also is the gun loaded?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Picking up the compass, Carmen holds it level. Rather than pointing north, it seems to slowly spin around as if undecided. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: That's odd</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The gun is not loaded, though you recall that there may have been a box of ammo for the pistol downstairs as well.</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): What's the Dmg dice for a .45? Better then my .357 I'm assuming?</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Probably about the same</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">GM: Magnum is 1d8+1d4 while the revolver is 1d10+2</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): 2-12 vs 3-12. Eh I'm not taking the old guy's gun I have one</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB">Professor Plato: [SKILL] Science - Forensics (65%) [Hard success] (Spend 12 of your 62 luck to make it an Extreme Success.)</font> [d100 = 25]<br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">looking over the scene, the Professor notices several details. The area close to the suitcase has a more noticeable sheen, but the area outside of it isn't consistent. It's almost a... splash of it, striking out along the ground and hitting the wall and the boxes and couch that are nearby. It's as if it built up pressure from within with some sort of fluid from within, then burst free. Picking up a set of pants, it looks like it may have come from those. The pocket is torn apart. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Wait is this the suitcase mentioned in the Journal?</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Might be. Does it have his travel tags on it? </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Someone look for that I want to check where it impacted area is by that couch nearby</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: Sure I'll check for travel tags</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Peeking underneath, the Lillian does see stickers and labels that identify it as belonging to Arthur Cornthwaite, and show that it's been to South America and back several times. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: This may in fact be the suitcase we're looking for </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: Then what escaped is likely whatever cursed thing he mentioned in his journal is</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: What?</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Joe Virelli looks between Carmen and the others, glancing from person to person</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carl Handy: That is the question Joe.  Things are afoot here.  Things beyond the norm.</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Joe Virelli smirks at the group, not buyingtheir joke. </font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica hands him Cornthwaite's Journal before checking to see for a hole or impact point by the &#34;splash&#34; hit the wall</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica &#34;The area close to the suitcase has a more noticeable sheen, but the area outside of it isn't consistant. It's almost a splash of it, striking out along the ground and hitting the wall and the boxes and couch that are nearby.&#34;</font><br />

<font color="#FFFFFF">Checking by the spot on the wall, Carmen doesn't notice any specific holes in the wall. However, the wall boards aren't always flush against one another, likewise with the floor boards in places. </font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The house creeks in the wind</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Are there splotch marks on the walls here similar to in the servants room?</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not so much, though the walls here are just bare wood rather than being plaster</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Yeah, yeah, I know the game. Y'all are just looking to make a name for yourself here, eh? </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Is there any substance left from whatever burst out or is it all dried at this point </font><br />

<font color="#63F7ED">Joe Virelli Nothing that  the group has encountered so far, especially the stuff from the suitcase and its surrounding walls, seems to actually be wet to the touch. </font><br />

<font color="#DA8ADB">Lillian Lovell: that seems dangerous ;w;</font><br />
<font color="#DA8ADB"> -&#62; GM: (delete first)</font><br />
<font color="#FFE6AB">Joe Virelli: Well I suppose he wouldn't have gone out of town without his suitcase</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: It seems like... something escaped from it, or pushed it's way out somehow.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: And he mentioned the fetish being in his pocket.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Professor Plato: I wonder if this might be the same thing I saw moving in the walls</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The house creeks again, the floor shaking slightly</font><br />
<font color="#63F7ED">Carmen Santamonica checks the compass again</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">The compass point spins rapidly</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: If there's nothing else of interest up here, let's get out of this attic.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen Santamonica: We should review what we know.</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">A box from the far side of the room falls to the ground</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lillian Lovell: It appears there may  still be something up here </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): I'll go take a look</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): cautiously</font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): 61 out of 60 I swear...</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">GM: You can burn one luck to get the success, or you can push it by walking in the same direction as Lillian, just by going around the left passageway in the clutter rather than the right one</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Fine I'll push it omg</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Gonna trip and fall on my face </font><br />

<font color="#66CC66">IllymetWaltsy (Carmen Santamonica): Brb drink refill :'D</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Carmen steps around the other side, parallel to Lillian. She steps around the edge, looking toward the far side where the box fell. She can see it, some of the clutter having fallen away, and she can see something behind it</font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): :&#62; :&#62; :&#62;</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">Enormous and bloated, a swell of green substance rises from the floor. A nightmareish mass of abhorrent corruption, a bubbling morass of translucent greenish gel in which swirl air pockets, and sickly pus-like matter. Ghastly pink mouths and bloated black eye-like organs slowly form along the surface, gaping and blinking in and out of existence. But she can tell one locks eyes with her. </font><br />
<font color="#66CC66">Ayji (Lillian Lovell): Is there a window up here I can jump out of</font><br />
<font color="#FFFFFF">What she doesn't see is the swell to her left, oozing out of the boards just behind her head, another tendral of the thing which lashes out and grabs her. </font><br />
